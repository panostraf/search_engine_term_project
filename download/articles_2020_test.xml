<title>iTop VPN | TechRadar</title>
<content>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more By Mike Williams 12 November 2021 iTop VPN's generous 700MB/day (21GB/month) free plan might be worth a look for simple, non-privacy-critical tasks, but the service has too many fundamental issues to justify handing over your cash.iTop VPN's generous 700MB/day (21GB/month) free plan might be worth a look for simple, non-privacy-critical tasks, but the service has too many fundamental issues to justify handing over your cash.iTop VPN is a free VPN service with an affordable paid plan and one or two unusual privacy extras.The free plan gives you 700MB of data per day (21GB per month), and a choice of 16 locations (including the US and UK), easily beating most of the competition.Paying for a subscription gets you access to 100+ locations and 1,800+ streaming and gaming-optimized servers. (P2P is supported, too, though only on a handful of specialist servers.)A longer-than-usual list of bonus features include split tunneling, along with ad, tracker and malware blocking, browser history cleaning, and a Security Reinforce tool checks your device privacy settings and warns of any problems.iTop VPN has apps for Windows, Mac (a recent addition), Android and iOS, and support for connecting up to five devices simultaneously.This VPN's monthly plan is priced at $11.99, not the highest we've seen, but more expensive than most.Paying six months upfront cuts the cost to $6.99 a month, but that's still above average. You're paying iTop $41.94 to get your six months of cover, for instance, but Private Internet Access only asks $39.95 for a full year ($3.33 a month).iTop isn't done yet, though. Opt for its annual plan and you'll get an extra year thrown in, giving you two year's protection for $2.31 a month. A handful of providers are even cheaper – Private Internet Access has a three-year plan for $2.19 a month, Ivacy and PrivadoVPN go even lower – but that still looks like a real bargain.iTop supports payments via card, PayPal and bank transfers. It's good to see that you can turn off auto-renewal when you purchase the service, too, ensuring you won't accidentally pay for a second term that you don't want.Even better, if you're unhappy, a 15-day 'no questions asked' money-back guarantee (7 days for monthly-billed plans) means you're able to get your first payment back, too.Most VPNs protect your privacy by using secure VPN protocols such as WireGuard and OpenVPN. This doesn't guarantee you'll be safe – a provider can easily make mistakes in how they're set up – but they're open source, so anyone can see how they work or check the code for problems.However, iTop uses a custom scheme of its own. The Windows app appears to make a fast proxy connection to the VPN server, then uses an open source package called WinDivert to direct your traffic through the tunnel, apparently encrypting it with iTop's own protocol.Maybe this is secure, maybe it's not, but the company doesn't provide enough information to judge. You can't check the encryption it uses, for instance.We noticed a separate privacy issue on the iTop VPN website. Its SSL certificate wasn't properly configured, and this allowed us to access areas of the site, including the Login page, using an unencrypted HTTP connection. Unless you're using the VPN, that risks exposing your credentials to snoopers.iTop scores another privacy thumbs-down for its order form, where it insisted we entered our full name, city and post or ZIP code. A tooltip tried to justify this by saying that the details 'allow us to contact you if there are any issues with your order.' Uh, isn't that what our email address is for?iTop VPN claims to have a no logging policy, and the privacy policy spells out what this means.The company does its best to sound reassuring, telling users: 'We do not log your activity while you are utilizing the Services, including your browsing history, the bandwidth you used, or how long you connected to VPN servers. We do not store your original IP address or the server IP address that you connect to.'Sounds good, but we already know this can't be entirely true. iTop VPN limits its free plan to 700MB a day, so to make this work it must log the bandwidth you use and associate it with a device ID.Scroll down the page and you'll find a 'What information we collect' section, which could also include a lot of data: '...operating system, device ID, Internet protocol addresses, browser type, browser language, referring/exit pages, clickstream data of our websites and our products or services, and the pages or features of our software or services accessed by you and the time spent there.'Some of that looks like it's referring to the website, not iTop's apps, but the fact that we're left to guess is a problem. A privacy policy should be clear and precise, not leave us with more questions than it answers.Whatever you think of iTop VPN's claims, the real problem here is the company hasn't had them confirmed by any kind of security or logging audit. We're left to take iTop on trust, and hope the firm is delivering what it promises.iTop VPN's apps look good and are stuffed with features, but also score poorly on many of the usability fundamentals.Hitting a big red Connect button should by default automatically connect you to the nearest server, for instance. But even though we were testing from the UK, the free app regularly connected us to Japan, and the paid plan sometimes chose Germany.An 'All Servers' list enables switching to another location, but this also isn't as easy as it should be. For example, the countries aren't sorted by name, continent, distance or any other order we could recognize (there are sequences like Korea, Russia, UK, Italy, Singapore and so on). And there's no Favorites system or Recently Used lists to help out.The app is missing some usability shortcuts we commonly see elsewhere. You can't double click a location name to connect, for instance – you must click a location's Connect button, instead. When the app does connect (or disconnect), there's no notification to alert you, so you won't know whether you're protected unless you keep an eye on the app interface.On the plus side, you get separate Streaming, Social and Gaming lists where you can view locations optimized for specific platforms (PUBG, Warzone, Netflix, Disney Plus, Amazon Prime, iPlayer, Hulu and more).Too much scrolling? The Quick Access pane lists 17 common reasons for using a VPN: Browse Privacy, Hide Location, Watch Netflix, Play PUBG, Unblock WhatsApp (or Telegram, Facebook, Twitter etc), and more. If you're looking to unblock Netflix, there's no need to scan down a lengthy list of servers and try to guess which is best: just tap 'Watch Netflix' and the app automatically chooses a location for you.These work well, and we like the flexibility. But we'd prefer iTop VPN to sort out some of the interface basics before it layers on any more extras.iTop VPN's Mac app mostly looks like the Windows build, but with a few very noticeable changes.There's no Downloading section, for instance – the P2P locations are in the 'All Servers' lists. The Quick Tasks section doesn't have a Play PUBG tile. There's no kill switch and no Settings menu (the Protocols list is now on the main screen). If you regularly use both the Windows and Mac apps, the differences could be a little confusing.The iOS app is all about simplicity, with no Settings menu, no kill switch, no P2P, no HTTPS protocol option, and absolutely no bonus privacy tools. Instead, you just get the location lists, a big Connect button and a choice of TCP/UDP protocols.There's good news in one iOS area. Cities are grouped into countries, making for a shorter and better-organized list. But it's still not sorted alphabetically (and to make it worse, the iOS app uses a different order to the Windows build).The Android app is essentially the iOS version with added split tunneling, and yet another sort order for the servers list. Not a big deal unless you're using iTop VPN on several platforms – only then will you need to remember where your favorite locations appear on each device.iTop VPN supports a kill switch to stop internet traffic if the VPN drops unexpectedly. We found the Windows app was mostly successful, but had some flaws. When we forcibly crashed the app, for instance, our VPN connection dropped, the kill switch didn't kick in, and our traffic was unprotected. And as the app doesn't raise any notifications, an affected user is unlikely to realize they're at risk in such a scenario.Split tunneling support allows you to decide which apps use the tunnel, and which don't. It's handy if you only need the VPN to unblock a couple of websites, say, as other apps can use your normal (and faster) connection. This worked well for us, directing only browsers through the VPN by default, but making it easy to add other apps as required.A DNS Protection feature claims to protect your DNS settings from modification by malware. You can also set your DNS to one of several public DNS providers, simply by choosing them from a list: Google, OpenDNS, Verizon, Comodo and DNS Advantage.The app has a handful of settings. You're able to launch it when Windows starts, optionally connect, and choose one of three protocol options: UDP, TCP and HTTPS. As iTop VPN doesn't use any standard VPN protocol, it's not completely clear what the effects of these settings might be, and the descriptions don't help much. (Choosing TCP apparently gets you 'high level privacy', for instance, while opting for UDP means faster speeds but 'more data usage for special occasions.')iTop VPN is also missing some of the more advanced settings we see with other apps. It won't automatically connect when you access insecure Wi-Fi, for example. There are no leak protection options, and we saw no way to control notifications.iTop VPN has some privacy and security extras that we've not seen with other VPNs.A Security Reinforce module scanned our PC for weak or non-standard security settings, then suggested appropriate changes. You'll need some technical knowledge to understand its report, but the advice looks good to us, and is likely to improve your system security.The Browser Privacy feature can check and clear your browsing tracks in Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Opera and even Internet Explorer.These tools aren't the best we've seen, and they're maybe not all suitable for a VPN. Most providers use their own DNS servers rather than OpenVPN or Google, for instance, as that ensures no one else gets to see the sites you visit.But there's also more power here than we expected. DNS Protection isn't something iTop VPN threw together in an afternoon, for instance – it's an IObit feature taken direct from IObit Malware Fighter. Put it all together and the extras could have some value for more experienced users. (Although, as with the main app interface, we'd be happier if the developer sorted out the core features before starting with piling on the extras.)iTop VPN apps have specialist locations for unblocking many platforms, making them far easier to use than many competitors. If you're looking to unblock a supported platform in the US, say, you don't have to start choosing US locations until you find one that works: just choose a service from the list and you're ready to go.We tried this with BBC iPlayer, often a tricky site to unblock, but iTop VPN got us access right away.iTop VPN has Disney Plus locations in New York and Los Angeles. They both worked for us.There are streaming locations for Amazon Prime in the US and UK, but we weren't so lucky with these. Amazon spotted what we were doing, displayed its 'your device is connected to the internet using a VPN or proxy service' and demanded we 'disable it and try again.'It was the same disappointing story with Netflix: iTop VPN has a couple of specialist Netflix servers (US and Korea) but neither worked for us.Getting us into two of our four test sites isn't bad, but other providers do much better. CyberGhost, ExpressVPN, Hide.me, Hola, PrivadoVPN, Private Internet Access, ProtonVPN and Surfshark all unblocked every one of our test platforms in recent reviews.We measured iTop VPN speeds from US and UK locations with a 1Gbps connection in both cases, using several performance testing sites and services (SpeedTest's website and command line app, nPerf, SpeedOfme and more). We checked the download speeds at least five times from each site, and then we repeated all the tests in an evening session.UK download speeds were very ordinary at 180-190Mbps, but US performance was much better, with peak median speeds of around 360-400Mps, even reaching 900Mbps at one point. We're skeptical about that peak score, as it only happened in a single session out of the 20 we ran in the US, and none of the others got near even half that speed. We think the 360-400Mbps figure is more representative of what you're likely to see.That's not a bad result, and it's a close match with the OpenVPN performance we see from the likes of HideMyAss! (270-410Mbps) and TunnelBear (330-350Mbps).iTop's results lag well behind many other VPNs, though, especially when they're using WireGuard and faster protocols (providers such as CyberGhost, IPVanish and NordVPN regularly hit 750-900Mbps).There's another issue, too. That 330-350Mbps we saw from TunnelBear was using a standard OpenVPN connection with a very well-understood level of encryption and security. But iTop VPN uses the company's own custom protocol, which means we can't be sure these figures are a fair comparison. If iTop VPN is using more basic encryption, for instance, that might give it a big performance advantage, but at the cost of some security.iTop VPN has a stack of powerful extras, but it misses on a lot of the VPN fundamentals: there is no OpenVPN or WireGuard, limited unblocking, a flawed kill switch, plus various privacy issues. Its 700MB per day (21GB a month) free plan might be worth considering, but we wouldn't use it for anything privacy-critical.Mike began his career as a lead software developer in the engineering world, where his creations were used by big-name companies from Rolls Royce to British Nuclear Fuels and British Aerospace.

<title>iTop VPN | TechRadar</title>
<content>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more By Mike Williams 12 November 2021 iTop VPN's generous 700MB/day (21GB/month) free plan might be worth a look for simple, non-privacy-critical tasks, but the service has too many fundamental issues to justify handing over your cash.iTop VPN's generous 700MB/day (21GB/month) free plan might be worth a look for simple, non-privacy-critical tasks, but the service has too many fundamental issues to justify handing over your cash.iTop VPN is a free VPN service with an affordable paid plan and one or two unusual privacy extras.The free plan gives you 700MB of data per day (21GB per month), and a choice of 16 locations (including the US and UK), easily beating most of the competition.Paying for a subscription gets you access to 100+ locations and 1,800+ streaming and gaming-optimized servers. (P2P is supported, too, though only on a handful of specialist servers.)A longer-than-usual list of bonus features include split tunneling, along with ad, tracker and malware blocking, browser history cleaning, and a Security Reinforce tool checks your device privacy settings and warns of any problems.iTop VPN has apps for Windows, Mac (a recent addition), Android and iOS, and support for connecting up to five devices simultaneously.This VPN's monthly plan is priced at $11.99, not the highest we've seen, but more expensive than most.Paying six months upfront cuts the cost to $6.99 a month, but that's still above average. You're paying iTop $41.94 to get your six months of cover, for instance, but Private Internet Access only asks $39.95 for a full year ($3.33 a month).iTop isn't done yet, though. Opt for its annual plan and you'll get an extra year thrown in, giving you two year's protection for $2.31 a month. A handful of providers are even cheaper – Private Internet Access has a three-year plan for $2.19 a month, Ivacy and PrivadoVPN go even lower – but that still looks like a real bargain.iTop supports payments via card, PayPal and bank transfers. It's good to see that you can turn off auto-renewal when you purchase the service, too, ensuring you won't accidentally pay for a second term that you don't want.Even better, if you're unhappy, a 15-day 'no questions asked' money-back guarantee (7 days for monthly-billed plans) means you're able to get your first payment back, too.Most VPNs protect your privacy by using secure VPN protocols such as WireGuard and OpenVPN. This doesn't guarantee you'll be safe – a provider can easily make mistakes in how they're set up – but they're open source, so anyone can see how they work or check the code for problems.However, iTop uses a custom scheme of its own. The Windows app appears to make a fast proxy connection to the VPN server, then uses an open source package called WinDivert to direct your traffic through the tunnel, apparently encrypting it with iTop's own protocol.Maybe this is secure, maybe it's not, but the company doesn't provide enough information to judge. You can't check the encryption it uses, for instance.We noticed a separate privacy issue on the iTop VPN website. Its SSL certificate wasn't properly configured, and this allowed us to access areas of the site, including the Login page, using an unencrypted HTTP connection. Unless you're using the VPN, that risks exposing your credentials to snoopers.iTop scores another privacy thumbs-down for its order form, where it insisted we entered our full name, city and post or ZIP code. A tooltip tried to justify this by saying that the details 'allow us to contact you if there are any issues with your order.' Uh, isn't that what our email address is for?iTop VPN claims to have a no logging policy, and the privacy policy spells out what this means.The company does its best to sound reassuring, telling users: 'We do not log your activity while you are utilizing the Services, including your browsing history, the bandwidth you used, or how long you connected to VPN servers. We do not store your original IP address or the server IP address that you connect to.'Sounds good, but we already know this can't be entirely true. iTop VPN limits its free plan to 700MB a day, so to make this work it must log the bandwidth you use and associate it with a device ID.Scroll down the page and you'll find a 'What information we collect' section, which could also include a lot of data: '...operating system, device ID, Internet protocol addresses, browser type, browser language, referring/exit pages, clickstream data of our websites and our products or services, and the pages or features of our software or services accessed by you and the time spent there.'Some of that looks like it's referring to the website, not iTop's apps, but the fact that we're left to guess is a problem. A privacy policy should be clear and precise, not leave us with more questions than it answers.Whatever you think of iTop VPN's claims, the real problem here is the company hasn't had them confirmed by any kind of security or logging audit. We're left to take iTop on trust, and hope the firm is delivering what it promises.iTop VPN's apps look good and are stuffed with features, but also score poorly on many of the usability fundamentals.Hitting a big red Connect button should by default automatically connect you to the nearest server, for instance. But even though we were testing from the UK, the free app regularly connected us to Japan, and the paid plan sometimes chose Germany.An 'All Servers' list enables switching to another location, but this also isn't as easy as it should be. For example, the countries aren't sorted by name, continent, distance or any other order we could recognize (there are sequences like Korea, Russia, UK, Italy, Singapore and so on). And there's no Favorites system or Recently Used lists to help out.The app is missing some usability shortcuts we commonly see elsewhere. You can't double click a location name to connect, for instance – you must click a location's Connect button, instead. When the app does connect (or disconnect), there's no notification to alert you, so you won't know whether you're protected unless you keep an eye on the app interface.On the plus side, you get separate Streaming, Social and Gaming lists where you can view locations optimized for specific platforms (PUBG, Warzone, Netflix, Disney Plus, Amazon Prime, iPlayer, Hulu and more).Too much scrolling? The Quick Access pane lists 17 common reasons for using a VPN: Browse Privacy, Hide Location, Watch Netflix, Play PUBG, Unblock WhatsApp (or Telegram, Facebook, Twitter etc), and more. If you're looking to unblock Netflix, there's no need to scan down a lengthy list of servers and try to guess which is best: just tap 'Watch Netflix' and the app automatically chooses a location for you.These work well, and we like the flexibility. But we'd prefer iTop VPN to sort out some of the interface basics before it layers on any more extras.iTop VPN's Mac app mostly looks like the Windows build, but with a few very noticeable changes.There's no Downloading section, for instance – the P2P locations are in the 'All Servers' lists. The Quick Tasks section doesn't have a Play PUBG tile. There's no kill switch and no Settings menu (the Protocols list is now on the main screen). If you regularly use both the Windows and Mac apps, the differences could be a little confusing.The iOS app is all about simplicity, with no Settings menu, no kill switch, no P2P, no HTTPS protocol option, and absolutely no bonus privacy tools. Instead, you just get the location lists, a big Connect button and a choice of TCP/UDP protocols.There's good news in one iOS area. Cities are grouped into countries, making for a shorter and better-organized list. But it's still not sorted alphabetically (and to make it worse, the iOS app uses a different order to the Windows build).The Android app is essentially the iOS version with added split tunneling, and yet another sort order for the servers list. Not a big deal unless you're using iTop VPN on several platforms – only then will you need to remember where your favorite locations appear on each device.iTop VPN supports a kill switch to stop internet traffic if the VPN drops unexpectedly. We found the Windows app was mostly successful, but had some flaws. When we forcibly crashed the app, for instance, our VPN connection dropped, the kill switch didn't kick in, and our traffic was unprotected. And as the app doesn't raise any notifications, an affected user is unlikely to realize they're at risk in such a scenario.Split tunneling support allows you to decide which apps use the tunnel, and which don't. It's handy if you only need the VPN to unblock a couple of websites, say, as other apps can use your normal (and faster) connection. This worked well for us, directing only browsers through the VPN by default, but making it easy to add other apps as required.A DNS Protection feature claims to protect your DNS settings from modification by malware. You can also set your DNS to one of several public DNS providers, simply by choosing them from a list: Google, OpenDNS, Verizon, Comodo and DNS Advantage.The app has a handful of settings. You're able to launch it when Windows starts, optionally connect, and choose one of three protocol options: UDP, TCP and HTTPS. As iTop VPN doesn't use any standard VPN protocol, it's not completely clear what the effects of these settings might be, and the descriptions don't help much. (Choosing TCP apparently gets you 'high level privacy', for instance, while opting for UDP means faster speeds but 'more data usage for special occasions.')iTop VPN is also missing some of the more advanced settings we see with other apps. It won't automatically connect when you access insecure Wi-Fi, for example. There are no leak protection options, and we saw no way to control notifications.iTop VPN has some privacy and security extras that we've not seen with other VPNs.A Security Reinforce module scanned our PC for weak or non-standard security settings, then suggested appropriate changes. You'll need some technical knowledge to understand its report, but the advice looks good to us, and is likely to improve your system security.The Browser Privacy feature can check and clear your browsing tracks in Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Opera and even Internet Explorer.These tools aren't the best we've seen, and they're maybe not all suitable for a VPN. Most providers use their own DNS servers rather than OpenVPN or Google, for instance, as that ensures no one else gets to see the sites you visit.But there's also more power here than we expected. DNS Protection isn't something iTop VPN threw together in an afternoon, for instance – it's an IObit feature taken direct from IObit Malware Fighter. Put it all together and the extras could have some value for more experienced users. (Although, as with the main app interface, we'd be happier if the developer sorted out the core features before starting with piling on the extras.)iTop VPN apps have specialist locations for unblocking many platforms, making them far easier to use than many competitors. If you're looking to unblock a supported platform in the US, say, you don't have to start choosing US locations until you find one that works: just choose a service from the list and you're ready to go.We tried this with BBC iPlayer, often a tricky site to unblock, but iTop VPN got us access right away.iTop VPN has Disney Plus locations in New York and Los Angeles. They both worked for us.There are streaming locations for Amazon Prime in the US and UK, but we weren't so lucky with these. Amazon spotted what we were doing, displayed its 'your device is connected to the internet using a VPN or proxy service' and demanded we 'disable it and try again.'It was the same disappointing story with Netflix: iTop VPN has a couple of specialist Netflix servers (US and Korea) but neither worked for us.Getting us into two of our four test sites isn't bad, but other providers do much better. CyberGhost, ExpressVPN, Hide.me, Hola, PrivadoVPN, Private Internet Access, ProtonVPN and Surfshark all unblocked every one of our test platforms in recent reviews.We measured iTop VPN speeds from US and UK locations with a 1Gbps connection in both cases, using several performance testing sites and services (SpeedTest's website and command line app, nPerf, SpeedOfme and more). We checked the download speeds at least five times from each site, and then we repeated all the tests in an evening session.UK download speeds were very ordinary at 180-190Mbps, but US performance was much better, with peak median speeds of around 360-400Mps, even reaching 900Mbps at one point. We're skeptical about that peak score, as it only happened in a single session out of the 20 we ran in the US, and none of the others got near even half that speed. We think the 360-400Mbps figure is more representative of what you're likely to see.That's not a bad result, and it's a close match with the OpenVPN performance we see from the likes of HideMyAss! (270-410Mbps) and TunnelBear (330-350Mbps).iTop's results lag well behind many other VPNs, though, especially when they're using WireGuard and faster protocols (providers such as CyberGhost, IPVanish and NordVPN regularly hit 750-900Mbps).There's another issue, too. That 330-350Mbps we saw from TunnelBear was using a standard OpenVPN connection with a very well-understood level of encryption and security. But iTop VPN uses the company's own custom protocol, which means we can't be sure these figures are a fair comparison. If iTop VPN is using more basic encryption, for instance, that might give it a big performance advantage, but at the cost of some security.iTop VPN has a stack of powerful extras, but it misses on a lot of the VPN fundamentals: there is no OpenVPN or WireGuard, limited unblocking, a flawed kill switch, plus various privacy issues. Its 700MB per day (21GB a month) free plan might be worth considering, but we wouldn't use it for anything privacy-critical.Mike began his career as a lead software developer in the engineering world, where his creations were used by big-name companies from Rolls Royce to British Nuclear Fuels and British Aerospace.

<title>iTop VPN | TechRadar</title>
<content>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more By Mike Williams 12 November 2021 iTop VPN's generous 700MB/day (21GB/month) free plan might be worth a look for simple, non-privacy-critical tasks, but the service has too many fundamental issues to justify handing over your cash.iTop VPN's generous 700MB/day (21GB/month) free plan might be worth a look for simple, non-privacy-critical tasks, but the service has too many fundamental issues to justify handing over your cash.iTop VPN is a free VPN service with an affordable paid plan and one or two unusual privacy extras.The free plan gives you 700MB of data per day (21GB per month), and a choice of 16 locations (including the US and UK), easily beating most of the competition.Paying for a subscription gets you access to 100+ locations and 1,800+ streaming and gaming-optimized servers. (P2P is supported, too, though only on a handful of specialist servers.)A longer-than-usual list of bonus features include split tunneling, along with ad, tracker and malware blocking, browser history cleaning, and a Security Reinforce tool checks your device privacy settings and warns of any problems.iTop VPN has apps for Windows, Mac (a recent addition), Android and iOS, and support for connecting up to five devices simultaneously.This VPN's monthly plan is priced at $11.99, not the highest we've seen, but more expensive than most.Paying six months upfront cuts the cost to $6.99 a month, but that's still above average. You're paying iTop $41.94 to get your six months of cover, for instance, but Private Internet Access only asks $39.95 for a full year ($3.33 a month).iTop isn't done yet, though. Opt for its annual plan and you'll get an extra year thrown in, giving you two year's protection for $2.31 a month. A handful of providers are even cheaper – Private Internet Access has a three-year plan for $2.19 a month, Ivacy and PrivadoVPN go even lower – but that still looks like a real bargain.iTop supports payments via card, PayPal and bank transfers. It's good to see that you can turn off auto-renewal when you purchase the service, too, ensuring you won't accidentally pay for a second term that you don't want.Even better, if you're unhappy, a 15-day 'no questions asked' money-back guarantee (7 days for monthly-billed plans) means you're able to get your first payment back, too.Most VPNs protect your privacy by using secure VPN protocols such as WireGuard and OpenVPN. This doesn't guarantee you'll be safe – a provider can easily make mistakes in how they're set up – but they're open source, so anyone can see how they work or check the code for problems.However, iTop uses a custom scheme of its own. The Windows app appears to make a fast proxy connection to the VPN server, then uses an open source package called WinDivert to direct your traffic through the tunnel, apparently encrypting it with iTop's own protocol.Maybe this is secure, maybe it's not, but the company doesn't provide enough information to judge. You can't check the encryption it uses, for instance.We noticed a separate privacy issue on the iTop VPN website. Its SSL certificate wasn't properly configured, and this allowed us to access areas of the site, including the Login page, using an unencrypted HTTP connection. Unless you're using the VPN, that risks exposing your credentials to snoopers.iTop scores another privacy thumbs-down for its order form, where it insisted we entered our full name, city and post or ZIP code. A tooltip tried to justify this by saying that the details 'allow us to contact you if there are any issues with your order.' Uh, isn't that what our email address is for?iTop VPN claims to have a no logging policy, and the privacy policy spells out what this means.The company does its best to sound reassuring, telling users: 'We do not log your activity while you are utilizing the Services, including your browsing history, the bandwidth you used, or how long you connected to VPN servers. We do not store your original IP address or the server IP address that you connect to.'Sounds good, but we already know this can't be entirely true. iTop VPN limits its free plan to 700MB a day, so to make this work it must log the bandwidth you use and associate it with a device ID.Scroll down the page and you'll find a 'What information we collect' section, which could also include a lot of data: '...operating system, device ID, Internet protocol addresses, browser type, browser language, referring/exit pages, clickstream data of our websites and our products or services, and the pages or features of our software or services accessed by you and the time spent there.'Some of that looks like it's referring to the website, not iTop's apps, but the fact that we're left to guess is a problem. A privacy policy should be clear and precise, not leave us with more questions than it answers.Whatever you think of iTop VPN's claims, the real problem here is the company hasn't had them confirmed by any kind of security or logging audit. We're left to take iTop on trust, and hope the firm is delivering what it promises.iTop VPN's apps look good and are stuffed with features, but also score poorly on many of the usability fundamentals.Hitting a big red Connect button should by default automatically connect you to the nearest server, for instance. But even though we were testing from the UK, the free app regularly connected us to Japan, and the paid plan sometimes chose Germany.An 'All Servers' list enables switching to another location, but this also isn't as easy as it should be. For example, the countries aren't sorted by name, continent, distance or any other order we could recognize (there are sequences like Korea, Russia, UK, Italy, Singapore and so on). And there's no Favorites system or Recently Used lists to help out.The app is missing some usability shortcuts we commonly see elsewhere. You can't double click a location name to connect, for instance – you must click a location's Connect button, instead. When the app does connect (or disconnect), there's no notification to alert you, so you won't know whether you're protected unless you keep an eye on the app interface.On the plus side, you get separate Streaming, Social and Gaming lists where you can view locations optimized for specific platforms (PUBG, Warzone, Netflix, Disney Plus, Amazon Prime, iPlayer, Hulu and more).Too much scrolling? The Quick Access pane lists 17 common reasons for using a VPN: Browse Privacy, Hide Location, Watch Netflix, Play PUBG, Unblock WhatsApp (or Telegram, Facebook, Twitter etc), and more. If you're looking to unblock Netflix, there's no need to scan down a lengthy list of servers and try to guess which is best: just tap 'Watch Netflix' and the app automatically chooses a location for you.These work well, and we like the flexibility. But we'd prefer iTop VPN to sort out some of the interface basics before it layers on any more extras.iTop VPN's Mac app mostly looks like the Windows build, but with a few very noticeable changes.There's no Downloading section, for instance – the P2P locations are in the 'All Servers' lists. The Quick Tasks section doesn't have a Play PUBG tile. There's no kill switch and no Settings menu (the Protocols list is now on the main screen). If you regularly use both the Windows and Mac apps, the differences could be a little confusing.The iOS app is all about simplicity, with no Settings menu, no kill switch, no P2P, no HTTPS protocol option, and absolutely no bonus privacy tools. Instead, you just get the location lists, a big Connect button and a choice of TCP/UDP protocols.There's good news in one iOS area. Cities are grouped into countries, making for a shorter and better-organized list. But it's still not sorted alphabetically (and to make it worse, the iOS app uses a different order to the Windows build).The Android app is essentially the iOS version with added split tunneling, and yet another sort order for the servers list. Not a big deal unless you're using iTop VPN on several platforms – only then will you need to remember where your favorite locations appear on each device.iTop VPN supports a kill switch to stop internet traffic if the VPN drops unexpectedly. We found the Windows app was mostly successful, but had some flaws. When we forcibly crashed the app, for instance, our VPN connection dropped, the kill switch didn't kick in, and our traffic was unprotected. And as the app doesn't raise any notifications, an affected user is unlikely to realize they're at risk in such a scenario.Split tunneling support allows you to decide which apps use the tunnel, and which don't. It's handy if you only need the VPN to unblock a couple of websites, say, as other apps can use your normal (and faster) connection. This worked well for us, directing only browsers through the VPN by default, but making it easy to add other apps as required.A DNS Protection feature claims to protect your DNS settings from modification by malware. You can also set your DNS to one of several public DNS providers, simply by choosing them from a list: Google, OpenDNS, Verizon, Comodo and DNS Advantage.The app has a handful of settings. You're able to launch it when Windows starts, optionally connect, and choose one of three protocol options: UDP, TCP and HTTPS. As iTop VPN doesn't use any standard VPN protocol, it's not completely clear what the effects of these settings might be, and the descriptions don't help much. (Choosing TCP apparently gets you 'high level privacy', for instance, while opting for UDP means faster speeds but 'more data usage for special occasions.')iTop VPN is also missing some of the more advanced settings we see with other apps. It won't automatically connect when you access insecure Wi-Fi, for example. There are no leak protection options, and we saw no way to control notifications.iTop VPN has some privacy and security extras that we've not seen with other VPNs.A Security Reinforce module scanned our PC for weak or non-standard security settings, then suggested appropriate changes. You'll need some technical knowledge to understand its report, but the advice looks good to us, and is likely to improve your system security.The Browser Privacy feature can check and clear your browsing tracks in Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Opera and even Internet Explorer.These tools aren't the best we've seen, and they're maybe not all suitable for a VPN. Most providers use their own DNS servers rather than OpenVPN or Google, for instance, as that ensures no one else gets to see the sites you visit.But there's also more power here than we expected. DNS Protection isn't something iTop VPN threw together in an afternoon, for instance – it's an IObit feature taken direct from IObit Malware Fighter. Put it all together and the extras could have some value for more experienced users. (Although, as with the main app interface, we'd be happier if the developer sorted out the core features before starting with piling on the extras.)iTop VPN apps have specialist locations for unblocking many platforms, making them far easier to use than many competitors. If you're looking to unblock a supported platform in the US, say, you don't have to start choosing US locations until you find one that works: just choose a service from the list and you're ready to go.We tried this with BBC iPlayer, often a tricky site to unblock, but iTop VPN got us access right away.iTop VPN has Disney Plus locations in New York and Los Angeles. They both worked for us.There are streaming locations for Amazon Prime in the US and UK, but we weren't so lucky with these. Amazon spotted what we were doing, displayed its 'your device is connected to the internet using a VPN or proxy service' and demanded we 'disable it and try again.'It was the same disappointing story with Netflix: iTop VPN has a couple of specialist Netflix servers (US and Korea) but neither worked for us.Getting us into two of our four test sites isn't bad, but other providers do much better. CyberGhost, ExpressVPN, Hide.me, Hola, PrivadoVPN, Private Internet Access, ProtonVPN and Surfshark all unblocked every one of our test platforms in recent reviews.We measured iTop VPN speeds from US and UK locations with a 1Gbps connection in both cases, using several performance testing sites and services (SpeedTest's website and command line app, nPerf, SpeedOfme and more). We checked the download speeds at least five times from each site, and then we repeated all the tests in an evening session.UK download speeds were very ordinary at 180-190Mbps, but US performance was much better, with peak median speeds of around 360-400Mps, even reaching 900Mbps at one point. We're skeptical about that peak score, as it only happened in a single session out of the 20 we ran in the US, and none of the others got near even half that speed. We think the 360-400Mbps figure is more representative of what you're likely to see.That's not a bad result, and it's a close match with the OpenVPN performance we see from the likes of HideMyAss! (270-410Mbps) and TunnelBear (330-350Mbps).iTop's results lag well behind many other VPNs, though, especially when they're using WireGuard and faster protocols (providers such as CyberGhost, IPVanish and NordVPN regularly hit 750-900Mbps).There's another issue, too. That 330-350Mbps we saw from TunnelBear was using a standard OpenVPN connection with a very well-understood level of encryption and security. But iTop VPN uses the company's own custom protocol, which means we can't be sure these figures are a fair comparison. If iTop VPN is using more basic encryption, for instance, that might give it a big performance advantage, but at the cost of some security.iTop VPN has a stack of powerful extras, but it misses on a lot of the VPN fundamentals: there is no OpenVPN or WireGuard, limited unblocking, a flawed kill switch, plus various privacy issues. Its 700MB per day (21GB a month) free plan might be worth considering, but we wouldn't use it for anything privacy-critical.Mike began his career as a lead software developer in the engineering world, where his creations were used by big-name companies from Rolls Royce to British Nuclear Fuels and British Aerospace.

<title>iTop VPN | TechRadar</title>
<content>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more By Mike Williams 12 November 2021 iTop VPN's generous 700MB/day (21GB/month) free plan might be worth a look for simple, non-privacy-critical tasks, but the service has too many fundamental issues to justify handing over your cash.iTop VPN's generous 700MB/day (21GB/month) free plan might be worth a look for simple, non-privacy-critical tasks, but the service has too many fundamental issues to justify handing over your cash.iTop VPN is a free VPN service with an affordable paid plan and one or two unusual privacy extras.The free plan gives you 700MB of data per day (21GB per month), and a choice of 16 locations (including the US and UK), easily beating most of the competition.Paying for a subscription gets you access to 100+ locations and 1,800+ streaming and gaming-optimized servers. (P2P is supported, too, though only on a handful of specialist servers.)A longer-than-usual list of bonus features include split tunneling, along with ad, tracker and malware blocking, browser history cleaning, and a Security Reinforce tool checks your device privacy settings and warns of any problems.iTop VPN has apps for Windows, Mac (a recent addition), Android and iOS, and support for connecting up to five devices simultaneously.This VPN's monthly plan is priced at $11.99, not the highest we've seen, but more expensive than most.Paying six months upfront cuts the cost to $6.99 a month, but that's still above average. You're paying iTop $41.94 to get your six months of cover, for instance, but Private Internet Access only asks $39.95 for a full year ($3.33 a month).iTop isn't done yet, though. Opt for its annual plan and you'll get an extra year thrown in, giving you two year's protection for $2.31 a month. A handful of providers are even cheaper – Private Internet Access has a three-year plan for $2.19 a month, Ivacy and PrivadoVPN go even lower – but that still looks like a real bargain.iTop supports payments via card, PayPal and bank transfers. It's good to see that you can turn off auto-renewal when you purchase the service, too, ensuring you won't accidentally pay for a second term that you don't want.Even better, if you're unhappy, a 15-day 'no questions asked' money-back guarantee (7 days for monthly-billed plans) means you're able to get your first payment back, too.Most VPNs protect your privacy by using secure VPN protocols such as WireGuard and OpenVPN. This doesn't guarantee you'll be safe – a provider can easily make mistakes in how they're set up – but they're open source, so anyone can see how they work or check the code for problems.However, iTop uses a custom scheme of its own. The Windows app appears to make a fast proxy connection to the VPN server, then uses an open source package called WinDivert to direct your traffic through the tunnel, apparently encrypting it with iTop's own protocol.Maybe this is secure, maybe it's not, but the company doesn't provide enough information to judge. You can't check the encryption it uses, for instance.We noticed a separate privacy issue on the iTop VPN website. Its SSL certificate wasn't properly configured, and this allowed us to access areas of the site, including the Login page, using an unencrypted HTTP connection. Unless you're using the VPN, that risks exposing your credentials to snoopers.iTop scores another privacy thumbs-down for its order form, where it insisted we entered our full name, city and post or ZIP code. A tooltip tried to justify this by saying that the details 'allow us to contact you if there are any issues with your order.' Uh, isn't that what our email address is for?iTop VPN claims to have a no logging policy, and the privacy policy spells out what this means.The company does its best to sound reassuring, telling users: 'We do not log your activity while you are utilizing the Services, including your browsing history, the bandwidth you used, or how long you connected to VPN servers. We do not store your original IP address or the server IP address that you connect to.'Sounds good, but we already know this can't be entirely true. iTop VPN limits its free plan to 700MB a day, so to make this work it must log the bandwidth you use and associate it with a device ID.Scroll down the page and you'll find a 'What information we collect' section, which could also include a lot of data: '...operating system, device ID, Internet protocol addresses, browser type, browser language, referring/exit pages, clickstream data of our websites and our products or services, and the pages or features of our software or services accessed by you and the time spent there.'Some of that looks like it's referring to the website, not iTop's apps, but the fact that we're left to guess is a problem. A privacy policy should be clear and precise, not leave us with more questions than it answers.Whatever you think of iTop VPN's claims, the real problem here is the company hasn't had them confirmed by any kind of security or logging audit. We're left to take iTop on trust, and hope the firm is delivering what it promises.iTop VPN's apps look good and are stuffed with features, but also score poorly on many of the usability fundamentals.Hitting a big red Connect button should by default automatically connect you to the nearest server, for instance. But even though we were testing from the UK, the free app regularly connected us to Japan, and the paid plan sometimes chose Germany.An 'All Servers' list enables switching to another location, but this also isn't as easy as it should be. For example, the countries aren't sorted by name, continent, distance or any other order we could recognize (there are sequences like Korea, Russia, UK, Italy, Singapore and so on). And there's no Favorites system or Recently Used lists to help out.The app is missing some usability shortcuts we commonly see elsewhere. You can't double click a location name to connect, for instance – you must click a location's Connect button, instead. When the app does connect (or disconnect), there's no notification to alert you, so you won't know whether you're protected unless you keep an eye on the app interface.On the plus side, you get separate Streaming, Social and Gaming lists where you can view locations optimized for specific platforms (PUBG, Warzone, Netflix, Disney Plus, Amazon Prime, iPlayer, Hulu and more).Too much scrolling? The Quick Access pane lists 17 common reasons for using a VPN: Browse Privacy, Hide Location, Watch Netflix, Play PUBG, Unblock WhatsApp (or Telegram, Facebook, Twitter etc), and more. If you're looking to unblock Netflix, there's no need to scan down a lengthy list of servers and try to guess which is best: just tap 'Watch Netflix' and the app automatically chooses a location for you.These work well, and we like the flexibility. But we'd prefer iTop VPN to sort out some of the interface basics before it layers on any more extras.iTop VPN's Mac app mostly looks like the Windows build, but with a few very noticeable changes.There's no Downloading section, for instance – the P2P locations are in the 'All Servers' lists. The Quick Tasks section doesn't have a Play PUBG tile. There's no kill switch and no Settings menu (the Protocols list is now on the main screen). If you regularly use both the Windows and Mac apps, the differences could be a little confusing.The iOS app is all about simplicity, with no Settings menu, no kill switch, no P2P, no HTTPS protocol option, and absolutely no bonus privacy tools. Instead, you just get the location lists, a big Connect button and a choice of TCP/UDP protocols.There's good news in one iOS area. Cities are grouped into countries, making for a shorter and better-organized list. But it's still not sorted alphabetically (and to make it worse, the iOS app uses a different order to the Windows build).The Android app is essentially the iOS version with added split tunneling, and yet another sort order for the servers list. Not a big deal unless you're using iTop VPN on several platforms – only then will you need to remember where your favorite locations appear on each device.iTop VPN supports a kill switch to stop internet traffic if the VPN drops unexpectedly. We found the Windows app was mostly successful, but had some flaws. When we forcibly crashed the app, for instance, our VPN connection dropped, the kill switch didn't kick in, and our traffic was unprotected. And as the app doesn't raise any notifications, an affected user is unlikely to realize they're at risk in such a scenario.Split tunneling support allows you to decide which apps use the tunnel, and which don't. It's handy if you only need the VPN to unblock a couple of websites, say, as other apps can use your normal (and faster) connection. This worked well for us, directing only browsers through the VPN by default, but making it easy to add other apps as required.A DNS Protection feature claims to protect your DNS settings from modification by malware. You can also set your DNS to one of several public DNS providers, simply by choosing them from a list: Google, OpenDNS, Verizon, Comodo and DNS Advantage.The app has a handful of settings. You're able to launch it when Windows starts, optionally connect, and choose one of three protocol options: UDP, TCP and HTTPS. As iTop VPN doesn't use any standard VPN protocol, it's not completely clear what the effects of these settings might be, and the descriptions don't help much. (Choosing TCP apparently gets you 'high level privacy', for instance, while opting for UDP means faster speeds but 'more data usage for special occasions.')iTop VPN is also missing some of the more advanced settings we see with other apps. It won't automatically connect when you access insecure Wi-Fi, for example. There are no leak protection options, and we saw no way to control notifications.iTop VPN has some privacy and security extras that we've not seen with other VPNs.A Security Reinforce module scanned our PC for weak or non-standard security settings, then suggested appropriate changes. You'll need some technical knowledge to understand its report, but the advice looks good to us, and is likely to improve your system security.The Browser Privacy feature can check and clear your browsing tracks in Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Opera and even Internet Explorer.These tools aren't the best we've seen, and they're maybe not all suitable for a VPN. Most providers use their own DNS servers rather than OpenVPN or Google, for instance, as that ensures no one else gets to see the sites you visit.But there's also more power here than we expected. DNS Protection isn't something iTop VPN threw together in an afternoon, for instance – it's an IObit feature taken direct from IObit Malware Fighter. Put it all together and the extras could have some value for more experienced users. (Although, as with the main app interface, we'd be happier if the developer sorted out the core features before starting with piling on the extras.)iTop VPN apps have specialist locations for unblocking many platforms, making them far easier to use than many competitors. If you're looking to unblock a supported platform in the US, say, you don't have to start choosing US locations until you find one that works: just choose a service from the list and you're ready to go.We tried this with BBC iPlayer, often a tricky site to unblock, but iTop VPN got us access right away.iTop VPN has Disney Plus locations in New York and Los Angeles. They both worked for us.There are streaming locations for Amazon Prime in the US and UK, but we weren't so lucky with these. Amazon spotted what we were doing, displayed its 'your device is connected to the internet using a VPN or proxy service' and demanded we 'disable it and try again.'It was the same disappointing story with Netflix: iTop VPN has a couple of specialist Netflix servers (US and Korea) but neither worked for us.Getting us into two of our four test sites isn't bad, but other providers do much better. CyberGhost, ExpressVPN, Hide.me, Hola, PrivadoVPN, Private Internet Access, ProtonVPN and Surfshark all unblocked every one of our test platforms in recent reviews.We measured iTop VPN speeds from US and UK locations with a 1Gbps connection in both cases, using several performance testing sites and services (SpeedTest's website and command line app, nPerf, SpeedOfme and more). We checked the download speeds at least five times from each site, and then we repeated all the tests in an evening session.UK download speeds were very ordinary at 180-190Mbps, but US performance was much better, with peak median speeds of around 360-400Mps, even reaching 900Mbps at one point. We're skeptical about that peak score, as it only happened in a single session out of the 20 we ran in the US, and none of the others got near even half that speed. We think the 360-400Mbps figure is more representative of what you're likely to see.That's not a bad result, and it's a close match with the OpenVPN performance we see from the likes of HideMyAss! (270-410Mbps) and TunnelBear (330-350Mbps).iTop's results lag well behind many other VPNs, though, especially when they're using WireGuard and faster protocols (providers such as CyberGhost, IPVanish and NordVPN regularly hit 750-900Mbps).There's another issue, too. That 330-350Mbps we saw from TunnelBear was using a standard OpenVPN connection with a very well-understood level of encryption and security. But iTop VPN uses the company's own custom protocol, which means we can't be sure these figures are a fair comparison. If iTop VPN is using more basic encryption, for instance, that might give it a big performance advantage, but at the cost of some security.iTop VPN has a stack of powerful extras, but it misses on a lot of the VPN fundamentals: there is no OpenVPN or WireGuard, limited unblocking, a flawed kill switch, plus various privacy issues. Its 700MB per day (21GB a month) free plan might be worth considering, but we wouldn't use it for anything privacy-critical.Mike began his career as a lead software developer in the engineering world, where his creations were used by big-name companies from Rolls Royce to British Nuclear Fuels and British Aerospace.

<title>FastVPN review | TechRadar</title>
<content>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more By Mike Williams 12 November 2021 Seriously cheap for the first year, but you can see why: the desktop apps are unreliable, and there are very features. For unblocking Netflix and basic tasks only.Seriously cheap for the first year, but you can see why: the desktop apps are unreliable, and there are very features. For unblocking Netflix and basic tasks only.FastVPN is a simple VPN owned by Namecheap, the popular domain registrar and web hosting service.If you're wondering why you should trust a domain registrar to run your VPN, good question. No need to worry, though; it's using servers run by an arm of StackPath, which has also provided the network for major VPN brands such as IPVanish and StrongVPN.Whoever owns the network, it's a decent size, with 1,000+ P2P-friendly servers spread across 75+ locations worldwide. Apps are available for Windows, Mac, iOS and Android; tutorials show how to set up the service on Linux and various routers, and, unusually, there are no annoying limits on the number of devices you can connect at one time.The feature list is basic, though, covering the bare essentials only. You get OpenVPN and IKEv2 protocol support (no WireGuard), secure DNS to reduce the chance of DNS leaks, a kill switch to block internet access if the VPN drops, and that's about it.FastVPN's starting prices are some of the lowest around, thanks to big discounts off your first term.Sign up for the monthly plan, for instance, and you'll pay nothing at all for the first month, effectively a 30-day free trial, rising to a still-excellent $5.88 on renewal.The annual plan is just $1 a month for year one, rising to $2.88 on renewal. There are no longer-term plans (the old three-year option has disappeared.)These are very low first-term prices (and they're pretty good on renewal, too). Private Internet Access is one of our go-to VPNs for value, but with monthly plans at $9.95, dropping to $3.33 paid annually, it's still no match for FastVPN.If you are tempted, you're able to by card or PayPal, and there's a 30-day money-back guarantee to protect you if it all goes wrong.The FastVPN website comments briefly on logging, saying you'll "keep your browsing activities to yourself with our strict no-log policy" and that the service "won’t track, collect, or share any of your logs". We searched the website for something more detailed, without any luck. The only extra information we found came from the Windows VPN app installer, which warned that it collected "aggregated anonymous app usage data, including your device and OS version so we can troubleshoot and improve our app", but "that's it", and that there's "no tracking of your personal identifiable information".We'd like a little more substance than that, and ideally a security or no-logging audit, but that doesn't seem likely to happen any time soon. FastVPN is targeted at the average consumer who wants something easy to use which 'just works', and not the kind of user who cares about session logging or whether it uses AES-256-CBC or GCM.FastVPN's Windows app opens with a default 'Best Available' server choice, and a 'Connect VPN' button. The client displays the name of your current network, too, a handy way to be sure you're connecting to the official coffee shop Wi-Fi, and not some shady open network nearby.A location picker to the left gives a list of countries (some with city-level choices), server load and ping time information (you can sort by those, too), simple Favorites system to easily group your most commonly used locations.Although this looked good in theory, real-world performance was poor. OpenVPN connections took up to 40 seconds, three to four times faster than we usually see, and IKEv2 connections were also poor at 18-20 seconds.That was just the start. Occasionally, after connecting, we found we couldn't access any websites. Sometimes the VPN dropped, complaining of various internal errors or that there was 'no network detected.' It didn't help that some of these error messages were layered on top of normal status information, making them difficult to read. Not a huge issue, but it all helps to create a poor impression of the app. We expect better from a big company such as Namecheap.Settings are relatively limited: auto-start options, a choice of protocol (IKEv2, OpenVPN TCP/ UDP, and a Scramble option to help bypass VPN blocking), and a kill switch to block internet access if the VPN drops.The app handled unexpected disconnects very well. We forcibly closed our IKEv2 connection, the app noticed, displayed a notification and reconnected at once. So, we closed the connection again, then kept closing it, as fast we could, interrupting every reconnect attempt. That's a level of stress testing which goes way beyond what you're likely to see in real life, but the app just waited until we'd finished, then reconnected as before.The kill switch generally worked well, too. Whatever we did to IKEv2 or OpenVPN connections, the app raised an alert, wasn't especially troubled by our extreme testing methods and reconnected as soon as it could, without ever leaving us unprotected. FastVPN's Android VPN app looks and feels very similar to the Windows edition: big green Connect button, by default you're connected to the nearest server, but you can choose something else from a searchable list of locations.We noticed small usability issues. The desktop app hides city locations by default, and they're only visible if you expand a specific country. The mobile app displays city and country names in the same list, so there's much more scrolling (and the cities aren't always displayed in alphabetical order, either.) Settings are basic, too, with protocol options reduced to OpenVPN UDP or TCP (no IKEv2, this time).FastVPN's iOS app is very similar, but does add one very useful feature. An Always On option enables automatically connecting to the VPN whenever you access untrusted networks, while also ignoring networks you know are safe (home, work, etc).These apps aren't bad, and they didn't have the technical issues we saw on the desktop. But they're also short on features, and can't begin to compete with the best VPNs.FastVPN doesn't make any specific claims about its website-unblocking abilities, but generally suggests it can help you 'securely unblock sites and content.'This certainly worked as a BBC iPlayer VPN, where FastVPN got us access with the first location we tried.The service scored an even big victory when it unblocked US Netflix, a task which defeats many big VPN names.But FastVPN couldn't keep up that level of success, and it failed with Amazon Prime Video and Disney+.That's not a bad result, but we've seen some providers do much better. CyberGhost, ExpressVPN, Hide.me, Private Internet Access, ProtonVPN and Surfshark all unblocked everything in their latest reviews.We measured FastVPN speeds from a UK data center with excellent connectivity and a 1Gbps connection, giving us room to see exactly what the service could do.FastVPN turned out to be not so fast after all, with both OpenVPN and IKEv2 speeds reaching a modest 250Mbps. That's better than some - NordVPN and IPVanish didn't reach 200Mbps with OpenVPN - but a long way behind OpenVPN leaders such as HideMyAss! (340-350Mbps), Hide.me (390Mbps) and ProtonVPN (400-460Mbps.)There's another problem. OpenVPN is the fastest protocol FastVPN supports, but most providers give you much more capable options. IPVanish's WireGuard connections hit 750-900Mbps in recent reviews, for instance, while NordVPN's NordLynx was a close match at 760-880Mbps.So despite the name, there's no chance this service will appear in our list of the truly fastest VPNs. But although FastVPN trails far behind in the speed stakes, it's also far from the worst we've seen, and the service should handle most browsing or streaming tasks with ease.FastVPN's ultra-low starter prices caught our eye, but the Windows app was unreliable and there are very few features. Could work as a cheap VPN for unblocking Netflix and other basic tasks, but this isn't the service for experienced or demanding users. Assuming you want something better, we'd suggest going for our #1 rated ExpressVPN or, to save on costs, the also brilliant Surfshark.Mike began his career as a lead software developer in the engineering world, where his creations were used by big-name companies from Rolls Royce to British Nuclear Fuels and British Aerospace.

<title>iTop VPN | TechRadar</title>
<content>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more By Mike Williams 12 November 2021 iTop VPN's generous 700MB/day (21GB/month) free plan might be worth a look for simple, non-privacy-critical tasks, but the service has too many fundamental issues to justify handing over your cash.iTop VPN's generous 700MB/day (21GB/month) free plan might be worth a look for simple, non-privacy-critical tasks, but the service has too many fundamental issues to justify handing over your cash.iTop VPN is a free VPN service with an affordable paid plan and one or two unusual privacy extras.The free plan gives you 700MB of data per day (21GB per month), and a choice of 16 locations (including the US and UK), easily beating most of the competition.Paying for a subscription gets you access to 100+ locations and 1,800+ streaming and gaming-optimized servers. (P2P is supported, too, though only on a handful of specialist servers.)A longer-than-usual list of bonus features include split tunneling, along with ad, tracker and malware blocking, browser history cleaning, and a Security Reinforce tool checks your device privacy settings and warns of any problems.iTop VPN has apps for Windows, Mac (a recent addition), Android and iOS, and support for connecting up to five devices simultaneously.This VPN's monthly plan is priced at $11.99, not the highest we've seen, but more expensive than most.Paying six months upfront cuts the cost to $6.99 a month, but that's still above average. You're paying iTop $41.94 to get your six months of cover, for instance, but Private Internet Access only asks $39.95 for a full year ($3.33 a month).iTop isn't done yet, though. Opt for its annual plan and you'll get an extra year thrown in, giving you two year's protection for $2.31 a month. A handful of providers are even cheaper – Private Internet Access has a three-year plan for $2.19 a month, Ivacy and PrivadoVPN go even lower – but that still looks like a real bargain.iTop supports payments via card, PayPal and bank transfers. It's good to see that you can turn off auto-renewal when you purchase the service, too, ensuring you won't accidentally pay for a second term that you don't want.Even better, if you're unhappy, a 15-day 'no questions asked' money-back guarantee (7 days for monthly-billed plans) means you're able to get your first payment back, too.Most VPNs protect your privacy by using secure VPN protocols such as WireGuard and OpenVPN. This doesn't guarantee you'll be safe – a provider can easily make mistakes in how they're set up – but they're open source, so anyone can see how they work or check the code for problems.However, iTop uses a custom scheme of its own. The Windows app appears to make a fast proxy connection to the VPN server, then uses an open source package called WinDivert to direct your traffic through the tunnel, apparently encrypting it with iTop's own protocol.Maybe this is secure, maybe it's not, but the company doesn't provide enough information to judge. You can't check the encryption it uses, for instance.We noticed a separate privacy issue on the iTop VPN website. Its SSL certificate wasn't properly configured, and this allowed us to access areas of the site, including the Login page, using an unencrypted HTTP connection. Unless you're using the VPN, that risks exposing your credentials to snoopers.iTop scores another privacy thumbs-down for its order form, where it insisted we entered our full name, city and post or ZIP code. A tooltip tried to justify this by saying that the details 'allow us to contact you if there are any issues with your order.' Uh, isn't that what our email address is for?iTop VPN claims to have a no logging policy, and the privacy policy spells out what this means.The company does its best to sound reassuring, telling users: 'We do not log your activity while you are utilizing the Services, including your browsing history, the bandwidth you used, or how long you connected to VPN servers. We do not store your original IP address or the server IP address that you connect to.'Sounds good, but we already know this can't be entirely true. iTop VPN limits its free plan to 700MB a day, so to make this work it must log the bandwidth you use and associate it with a device ID.Scroll down the page and you'll find a 'What information we collect' section, which could also include a lot of data: '...operating system, device ID, Internet protocol addresses, browser type, browser language, referring/exit pages, clickstream data of our websites and our products or services, and the pages or features of our software or services accessed by you and the time spent there.'Some of that looks like it's referring to the website, not iTop's apps, but the fact that we're left to guess is a problem. A privacy policy should be clear and precise, not leave us with more questions than it answers.Whatever you think of iTop VPN's claims, the real problem here is the company hasn't had them confirmed by any kind of security or logging audit. We're left to take iTop on trust, and hope the firm is delivering what it promises.iTop VPN's apps look good and are stuffed with features, but also score poorly on many of the usability fundamentals.Hitting a big red Connect button should by default automatically connect you to the nearest server, for instance. But even though we were testing from the UK, the free app regularly connected us to Japan, and the paid plan sometimes chose Germany.An 'All Servers' list enables switching to another location, but this also isn't as easy as it should be. For example, the countries aren't sorted by name, continent, distance or any other order we could recognize (there are sequences like Korea, Russia, UK, Italy, Singapore and so on). And there's no Favorites system or Recently Used lists to help out.The app is missing some usability shortcuts we commonly see elsewhere. You can't double click a location name to connect, for instance – you must click a location's Connect button, instead. When the app does connect (or disconnect), there's no notification to alert you, so you won't know whether you're protected unless you keep an eye on the app interface.On the plus side, you get separate Streaming, Social and Gaming lists where you can view locations optimized for specific platforms (PUBG, Warzone, Netflix, Disney Plus, Amazon Prime, iPlayer, Hulu and more).Too much scrolling? The Quick Access pane lists 17 common reasons for using a VPN: Browse Privacy, Hide Location, Watch Netflix, Play PUBG, Unblock WhatsApp (or Telegram, Facebook, Twitter etc), and more. If you're looking to unblock Netflix, there's no need to scan down a lengthy list of servers and try to guess which is best: just tap 'Watch Netflix' and the app automatically chooses a location for you.These work well, and we like the flexibility. But we'd prefer iTop VPN to sort out some of the interface basics before it layers on any more extras.iTop VPN's Mac app mostly looks like the Windows build, but with a few very noticeable changes.There's no Downloading section, for instance – the P2P locations are in the 'All Servers' lists. The Quick Tasks section doesn't have a Play PUBG tile. There's no kill switch and no Settings menu (the Protocols list is now on the main screen). If you regularly use both the Windows and Mac apps, the differences could be a little confusing.The iOS app is all about simplicity, with no Settings menu, no kill switch, no P2P, no HTTPS protocol option, and absolutely no bonus privacy tools. Instead, you just get the location lists, a big Connect button and a choice of TCP/UDP protocols.There's good news in one iOS area. Cities are grouped into countries, making for a shorter and better-organized list. But it's still not sorted alphabetically (and to make it worse, the iOS app uses a different order to the Windows build).The Android app is essentially the iOS version with added split tunneling, and yet another sort order for the servers list. Not a big deal unless you're using iTop VPN on several platforms – only then will you need to remember where your favorite locations appear on each device.iTop VPN supports a kill switch to stop internet traffic if the VPN drops unexpectedly. We found the Windows app was mostly successful, but had some flaws. When we forcibly crashed the app, for instance, our VPN connection dropped, the kill switch didn't kick in, and our traffic was unprotected. And as the app doesn't raise any notifications, an affected user is unlikely to realize they're at risk in such a scenario.Split tunneling support allows you to decide which apps use the tunnel, and which don't. It's handy if you only need the VPN to unblock a couple of websites, say, as other apps can use your normal (and faster) connection. This worked well for us, directing only browsers through the VPN by default, but making it easy to add other apps as required.A DNS Protection feature claims to protect your DNS settings from modification by malware. You can also set your DNS to one of several public DNS providers, simply by choosing them from a list: Google, OpenDNS, Verizon, Comodo and DNS Advantage.The app has a handful of settings. You're able to launch it when Windows starts, optionally connect, and choose one of three protocol options: UDP, TCP and HTTPS. As iTop VPN doesn't use any standard VPN protocol, it's not completely clear what the effects of these settings might be, and the descriptions don't help much. (Choosing TCP apparently gets you 'high level privacy', for instance, while opting for UDP means faster speeds but 'more data usage for special occasions.')iTop VPN is also missing some of the more advanced settings we see with other apps. It won't automatically connect when you access insecure Wi-Fi, for example. There are no leak protection options, and we saw no way to control notifications.iTop VPN has some privacy and security extras that we've not seen with other VPNs.A Security Reinforce module scanned our PC for weak or non-standard security settings, then suggested appropriate changes. You'll need some technical knowledge to understand its report, but the advice looks good to us, and is likely to improve your system security.The Browser Privacy feature can check and clear your browsing tracks in Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Opera and even Internet Explorer.These tools aren't the best we've seen, and they're maybe not all suitable for a VPN. Most providers use their own DNS servers rather than OpenVPN or Google, for instance, as that ensures no one else gets to see the sites you visit.But there's also more power here than we expected. DNS Protection isn't something iTop VPN threw together in an afternoon, for instance – it's an IObit feature taken direct from IObit Malware Fighter. Put it all together and the extras could have some value for more experienced users. (Although, as with the main app interface, we'd be happier if the developer sorted out the core features before starting with piling on the extras.)iTop VPN apps have specialist locations for unblocking many platforms, making them far easier to use than many competitors. If you're looking to unblock a supported platform in the US, say, you don't have to start choosing US locations until you find one that works: just choose a service from the list and you're ready to go.We tried this with BBC iPlayer, often a tricky site to unblock, but iTop VPN got us access right away.iTop VPN has Disney Plus locations in New York and Los Angeles. They both worked for us.There are streaming locations for Amazon Prime in the US and UK, but we weren't so lucky with these. Amazon spotted what we were doing, displayed its 'your device is connected to the internet using a VPN or proxy service' and demanded we 'disable it and try again.'It was the same disappointing story with Netflix: iTop VPN has a couple of specialist Netflix servers (US and Korea) but neither worked for us.Getting us into two of our four test sites isn't bad, but other providers do much better. CyberGhost, ExpressVPN, Hide.me, Hola, PrivadoVPN, Private Internet Access, ProtonVPN and Surfshark all unblocked every one of our test platforms in recent reviews.We measured iTop VPN speeds from US and UK locations with a 1Gbps connection in both cases, using several performance testing sites and services (SpeedTest's website and command line app, nPerf, SpeedOfme and more). We checked the download speeds at least five times from each site, and then we repeated all the tests in an evening session.UK download speeds were very ordinary at 180-190Mbps, but US performance was much better, with peak median speeds of around 360-400Mps, even reaching 900Mbps at one point. We're skeptical about that peak score, as it only happened in a single session out of the 20 we ran in the US, and none of the others got near even half that speed. We think the 360-400Mbps figure is more representative of what you're likely to see.That's not a bad result, and it's a close match with the OpenVPN performance we see from the likes of HideMyAss! (270-410Mbps) and TunnelBear (330-350Mbps).iTop's results lag well behind many other VPNs, though, especially when they're using WireGuard and faster protocols (providers such as CyberGhost, IPVanish and NordVPN regularly hit 750-900Mbps).There's another issue, too. That 330-350Mbps we saw from TunnelBear was using a standard OpenVPN connection with a very well-understood level of encryption and security. But iTop VPN uses the company's own custom protocol, which means we can't be sure these figures are a fair comparison. If iTop VPN is using more basic encryption, for instance, that might give it a big performance advantage, but at the cost of some security.iTop VPN has a stack of powerful extras, but it misses on a lot of the VPN fundamentals: there is no OpenVPN or WireGuard, limited unblocking, a flawed kill switch, plus various privacy issues. Its 700MB per day (21GB a month) free plan might be worth considering, but we wouldn't use it for anything privacy-critical.Mike began his career as a lead software developer in the engineering world, where his creations were used by big-name companies from Rolls Royce to British Nuclear Fuels and British Aerospace.

<title>FastVPN review | TechRadar</title>
<content>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more By Mike Williams 12 November 2021 Seriously cheap for the first year, but you can see why: the desktop apps are unreliable, and there are very features. For unblocking Netflix and basic tasks only.Seriously cheap for the first year, but you can see why: the desktop apps are unreliable, and there are very features. For unblocking Netflix and basic tasks only.FastVPN is a simple VPN owned by Namecheap, the popular domain registrar and web hosting service.If you're wondering why you should trust a domain registrar to run your VPN, good question. No need to worry, though; it's using servers run by an arm of StackPath, which has also provided the network for major VPN brands such as IPVanish and StrongVPN.Whoever owns the network, it's a decent size, with 1,000+ P2P-friendly servers spread across 75+ locations worldwide. Apps are available for Windows, Mac, iOS and Android; tutorials show how to set up the service on Linux and various routers, and, unusually, there are no annoying limits on the number of devices you can connect at one time.The feature list is basic, though, covering the bare essentials only. You get OpenVPN and IKEv2 protocol support (no WireGuard), secure DNS to reduce the chance of DNS leaks, a kill switch to block internet access if the VPN drops, and that's about it.FastVPN's starting prices are some of the lowest around, thanks to big discounts off your first term.Sign up for the monthly plan, for instance, and you'll pay nothing at all for the first month, effectively a 30-day free trial, rising to a still-excellent $5.88 on renewal.The annual plan is just $1 a month for year one, rising to $2.88 on renewal. There are no longer-term plans (the old three-year option has disappeared.)These are very low first-term prices (and they're pretty good on renewal, too). Private Internet Access is one of our go-to VPNs for value, but with monthly plans at $9.95, dropping to $3.33 paid annually, it's still no match for FastVPN.If you are tempted, you're able to by card or PayPal, and there's a 30-day money-back guarantee to protect you if it all goes wrong.The FastVPN website comments briefly on logging, saying you'll "keep your browsing activities to yourself with our strict no-log policy" and that the service "won’t track, collect, or share any of your logs". We searched the website for something more detailed, without any luck. The only extra information we found came from the Windows VPN app installer, which warned that it collected "aggregated anonymous app usage data, including your device and OS version so we can troubleshoot and improve our app", but "that's it", and that there's "no tracking of your personal identifiable information".We'd like a little more substance than that, and ideally a security or no-logging audit, but that doesn't seem likely to happen any time soon. FastVPN is targeted at the average consumer who wants something easy to use which 'just works', and not the kind of user who cares about session logging or whether it uses AES-256-CBC or GCM.FastVPN's Windows app opens with a default 'Best Available' server choice, and a 'Connect VPN' button. The client displays the name of your current network, too, a handy way to be sure you're connecting to the official coffee shop Wi-Fi, and not some shady open network nearby.A location picker to the left gives a list of countries (some with city-level choices), server load and ping time information (you can sort by those, too), simple Favorites system to easily group your most commonly used locations.Although this looked good in theory, real-world performance was poor. OpenVPN connections took up to 40 seconds, three to four times faster than we usually see, and IKEv2 connections were also poor at 18-20 seconds.That was just the start. Occasionally, after connecting, we found we couldn't access any websites. Sometimes the VPN dropped, complaining of various internal errors or that there was 'no network detected.' It didn't help that some of these error messages were layered on top of normal status information, making them difficult to read. Not a huge issue, but it all helps to create a poor impression of the app. We expect better from a big company such as Namecheap.Settings are relatively limited: auto-start options, a choice of protocol (IKEv2, OpenVPN TCP/ UDP, and a Scramble option to help bypass VPN blocking), and a kill switch to block internet access if the VPN drops.The app handled unexpected disconnects very well. We forcibly closed our IKEv2 connection, the app noticed, displayed a notification and reconnected at once. So, we closed the connection again, then kept closing it, as fast we could, interrupting every reconnect attempt. That's a level of stress testing which goes way beyond what you're likely to see in real life, but the app just waited until we'd finished, then reconnected as before.The kill switch generally worked well, too. Whatever we did to IKEv2 or OpenVPN connections, the app raised an alert, wasn't especially troubled by our extreme testing methods and reconnected as soon as it could, without ever leaving us unprotected. FastVPN's Android VPN app looks and feels very similar to the Windows edition: big green Connect button, by default you're connected to the nearest server, but you can choose something else from a searchable list of locations.We noticed small usability issues. The desktop app hides city locations by default, and they're only visible if you expand a specific country. The mobile app displays city and country names in the same list, so there's much more scrolling (and the cities aren't always displayed in alphabetical order, either.) Settings are basic, too, with protocol options reduced to OpenVPN UDP or TCP (no IKEv2, this time).FastVPN's iOS app is very similar, but does add one very useful feature. An Always On option enables automatically connecting to the VPN whenever you access untrusted networks, while also ignoring networks you know are safe (home, work, etc).These apps aren't bad, and they didn't have the technical issues we saw on the desktop. But they're also short on features, and can't begin to compete with the best VPNs.FastVPN doesn't make any specific claims about its website-unblocking abilities, but generally suggests it can help you 'securely unblock sites and content.'This certainly worked as a BBC iPlayer VPN, where FastVPN got us access with the first location we tried.The service scored an even big victory when it unblocked US Netflix, a task which defeats many big VPN names.But FastVPN couldn't keep up that level of success, and it failed with Amazon Prime Video and Disney+.That's not a bad result, but we've seen some providers do much better. CyberGhost, ExpressVPN, Hide.me, Private Internet Access, ProtonVPN and Surfshark all unblocked everything in their latest reviews.We measured FastVPN speeds from a UK data center with excellent connectivity and a 1Gbps connection, giving us room to see exactly what the service could do.FastVPN turned out to be not so fast after all, with both OpenVPN and IKEv2 speeds reaching a modest 250Mbps. That's better than some - NordVPN and IPVanish didn't reach 200Mbps with OpenVPN - but a long way behind OpenVPN leaders such as HideMyAss! (340-350Mbps), Hide.me (390Mbps) and ProtonVPN (400-460Mbps.)There's another problem. OpenVPN is the fastest protocol FastVPN supports, but most providers give you much more capable options. IPVanish's WireGuard connections hit 750-900Mbps in recent reviews, for instance, while NordVPN's NordLynx was a close match at 760-880Mbps.So despite the name, there's no chance this service will appear in our list of the truly fastest VPNs. But although FastVPN trails far behind in the speed stakes, it's also far from the worst we've seen, and the service should handle most browsing or streaming tasks with ease.FastVPN's ultra-low starter prices caught our eye, but the Windows app was unreliable and there are very few features. Could work as a cheap VPN for unblocking Netflix and other basic tasks, but this isn't the service for experienced or demanding users. Assuming you want something better, we'd suggest going for our #1 rated ExpressVPN or, to save on costs, the also brilliant Surfshark.Mike began his career as a lead software developer in the engineering world, where his creations were used by big-name companies from Rolls Royce to British Nuclear Fuels and British Aerospace.

<title>Zoho Recruit review | TechRadar</title>
<content>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more By Mike Jennings 12 November 2021 Zoho Recruit offers excellent features that are easy to use though this recruitment tool can be expensive for smaller businesses.Zoho Recruit offers excellent features that are easy to use though this recruitment tool can be expensive for smaller businesses.Zoho Recruit is one of the biggest Applicant Tracking System (ATS) services in the world, so it’s going to be right at the top of most people’s lists if they need some help with their hunt for top-quality staff.There’s plenty going for Zoho Recruit, including a free option and a broad range of features. Still, we’ve also got questions about some of the firm’s support options and integration abilities.Zoho Recruit has a broad range of features that are divided into three kinds of product – one for companies, another for recruitment agencies and a third for people who need to hire temporary staff.The Corporate HR product allows you to post job openings to hundreds of different mainstream and niche job boards, and you can boost job listings on social networks. You can also search through resumes with AI-powered modules that will find candidates on your behalf. You can set up a dedicated resume inbox and invite recruiters to submit potential candidates through a portal with your own branding. You can also establish an employee referral portal to allow your existing staff to give recommendations.Zoho’s AI features are robust and impressive. Applicants can be graded in advance based on your preferred traits and requirements, and advanced searches help narrow down the candidate pool.You can use Zoho’s background screening module to run background checks so you can adhere to your preferred hiring practices, and you can ask candidates to complete pre-screening assessments to help eliminate unsuitable people and streamline the process.HR staff and candidates can access dedicated portals to track the status of applications, and Zoho allows you to track recruitment stats and analyze data. Thanks to a customized series of alerts, rules, and actions, corporate HR staff can also automate much of the recruitment process. Impressively, Zoho’s entire experience can be customized, from the branding and aesthetic of the software to custom tabs and layout options.Switch over to Zoho’s agency module, and you get the same features alongside options to have powerful client portals that allow agency clients to create vacancies easily, send feedback and invite people to interview. And if you use Zoho’s temporary staff product, you’ll receive help from straightforward and powerful scheduling and timesheet tools alongside electronic signatures and invoicing to speed up laborious parts of the process. Temporary workers can also access their own portal to mark their availability and view their workloads.Zoho does have good features, but some things are missing here too. Zoho Recruit has integrations with Outlook, LinkedIn, Google Suite, and a selection of other products and services, but you’ll find more integration ability elsewhere.This service doesn’t have as many behavioral, skill, and cognitive testing options as some other recruitment services, either. You only get 24/7 support if you pay extra, too – standard plans only have support five days of the week.Zoho’s broader company offers a full range of HR products, which is excellent if you want to pick and choose features or opt for a more comprehensive HR solution. Sadly, though, that means you don’t get onboarding unless you pay more.Zoho’s standard Corporate HR package costs $25 per month if you buy annually, and you get the service’s core features alongside candidate sourcing, resume management, tracking, and Google, Zoho, and Microsoft Outlook integrations. If you buy the $50 per month Enterprise product, you get AI-powered candidate matching, improvement portal management, and advanced customization. On top of that, you’ll need to pay extra for hiring manager and vendor portal licenses.Recruitment agencies can pay for $25, $50, and $75 tiers, with the two latter options adding extra features. That $50 choice adds AI matching, advanced analytics, better security control, portal management, and candidate assessment options. The top-tier service adds more customization and portal options.The temporary employee package has a simple, single price of $59 a month, although you’ll have to pay more if you want to hire more than 25 employees.Zoho Recruit’s three products also have free tiers that give you candidate management, interview scheduling, and simple resume search options alongside other basic features. Still, these options are restrictive – HR departments can only list one vacancy at a time, and the temporary staff package is limited to five people.Zoho Recruit has an impressive selection of features, no matter which package you choose. It doesn’t require a huge amount of technical knowledge to use and excels when it comes to customization and AI-powered extras. It offers a broad slate of recruitment options for HR departments, temporary staff needs, and agencies, and it can be easily incorporated into a wider HR product if necessary.The costs can mount up, especially if you want a full HR or recruitment solution, and you may want to look elsewhere if you need more testing options, extension integration, or better support.For most companies and agencies, though, Zoho Recruit will prove excellent, and is one of the recruitment services you need to consider.We've also featured the best recruitment platforms, best HR software and best background check servicesSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!Thank you for signing up to TechRadar.

<title>iTop VPN | TechRadar</title>
<content>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more By Mike Williams 12 November 2021 iTop VPN's generous 700MB/day (21GB/month) free plan might be worth a look for simple, non-privacy-critical tasks, but the service has too many fundamental issues to justify handing over your cash.iTop VPN's generous 700MB/day (21GB/month) free plan might be worth a look for simple, non-privacy-critical tasks, but the service has too many fundamental issues to justify handing over your cash.iTop VPN is a free VPN service with an affordable paid plan and one or two unusual privacy extras.The free plan gives you 700MB of data per day (21GB per month), and a choice of 16 locations (including the US and UK), easily beating most of the competition.Paying for a subscription gets you access to 100+ locations and 1,800+ streaming and gaming-optimized servers. (P2P is supported, too, though only on a handful of specialist servers.)A longer-than-usual list of bonus features include split tunneling, along with ad, tracker and malware blocking, browser history cleaning, and a Security Reinforce tool checks your device privacy settings and warns of any problems.iTop VPN has apps for Windows, Mac (a recent addition), Android and iOS, and support for connecting up to five devices simultaneously.This VPN's monthly plan is priced at $11.99, not the highest we've seen, but more expensive than most.Paying six months upfront cuts the cost to $6.99 a month, but that's still above average. You're paying iTop $41.94 to get your six months of cover, for instance, but Private Internet Access only asks $39.95 for a full year ($3.33 a month).iTop isn't done yet, though. Opt for its annual plan and you'll get an extra year thrown in, giving you two year's protection for $2.31 a month. A handful of providers are even cheaper – Private Internet Access has a three-year plan for $2.19 a month, Ivacy and PrivadoVPN go even lower – but that still looks like a real bargain.iTop supports payments via card, PayPal and bank transfers. It's good to see that you can turn off auto-renewal when you purchase the service, too, ensuring you won't accidentally pay for a second term that you don't want.Even better, if you're unhappy, a 15-day 'no questions asked' money-back guarantee (7 days for monthly-billed plans) means you're able to get your first payment back, too.Most VPNs protect your privacy by using secure VPN protocols such as WireGuard and OpenVPN. This doesn't guarantee you'll be safe – a provider can easily make mistakes in how they're set up – but they're open source, so anyone can see how they work or check the code for problems.However, iTop uses a custom scheme of its own. The Windows app appears to make a fast proxy connection to the VPN server, then uses an open source package called WinDivert to direct your traffic through the tunnel, apparently encrypting it with iTop's own protocol.Maybe this is secure, maybe it's not, but the company doesn't provide enough information to judge. You can't check the encryption it uses, for instance.We noticed a separate privacy issue on the iTop VPN website. Its SSL certificate wasn't properly configured, and this allowed us to access areas of the site, including the Login page, using an unencrypted HTTP connection. Unless you're using the VPN, that risks exposing your credentials to snoopers.iTop scores another privacy thumbs-down for its order form, where it insisted we entered our full name, city and post or ZIP code. A tooltip tried to justify this by saying that the details 'allow us to contact you if there are any issues with your order.' Uh, isn't that what our email address is for?iTop VPN claims to have a no logging policy, and the privacy policy spells out what this means.The company does its best to sound reassuring, telling users: 'We do not log your activity while you are utilizing the Services, including your browsing history, the bandwidth you used, or how long you connected to VPN servers. We do not store your original IP address or the server IP address that you connect to.'Sounds good, but we already know this can't be entirely true. iTop VPN limits its free plan to 700MB a day, so to make this work it must log the bandwidth you use and associate it with a device ID.Scroll down the page and you'll find a 'What information we collect' section, which could also include a lot of data: '...operating system, device ID, Internet protocol addresses, browser type, browser language, referring/exit pages, clickstream data of our websites and our products or services, and the pages or features of our software or services accessed by you and the time spent there.'Some of that looks like it's referring to the website, not iTop's apps, but the fact that we're left to guess is a problem. A privacy policy should be clear and precise, not leave us with more questions than it answers.Whatever you think of iTop VPN's claims, the real problem here is the company hasn't had them confirmed by any kind of security or logging audit. We're left to take iTop on trust, and hope the firm is delivering what it promises.iTop VPN's apps look good and are stuffed with features, but also score poorly on many of the usability fundamentals.Hitting a big red Connect button should by default automatically connect you to the nearest server, for instance. But even though we were testing from the UK, the free app regularly connected us to Japan, and the paid plan sometimes chose Germany.An 'All Servers' list enables switching to another location, but this also isn't as easy as it should be. For example, the countries aren't sorted by name, continent, distance or any other order we could recognize (there are sequences like Korea, Russia, UK, Italy, Singapore and so on). And there's no Favorites system or Recently Used lists to help out.The app is missing some usability shortcuts we commonly see elsewhere. You can't double click a location name to connect, for instance – you must click a location's Connect button, instead. When the app does connect (or disconnect), there's no notification to alert you, so you won't know whether you're protected unless you keep an eye on the app interface.On the plus side, you get separate Streaming, Social and Gaming lists where you can view locations optimized for specific platforms (PUBG, Warzone, Netflix, Disney Plus, Amazon Prime, iPlayer, Hulu and more).Too much scrolling? The Quick Access pane lists 17 common reasons for using a VPN: Browse Privacy, Hide Location, Watch Netflix, Play PUBG, Unblock WhatsApp (or Telegram, Facebook, Twitter etc), and more. If you're looking to unblock Netflix, there's no need to scan down a lengthy list of servers and try to guess which is best: just tap 'Watch Netflix' and the app automatically chooses a location for you.These work well, and we like the flexibility. But we'd prefer iTop VPN to sort out some of the interface basics before it layers on any more extras.iTop VPN's Mac app mostly looks like the Windows build, but with a few very noticeable changes.There's no Downloading section, for instance – the P2P locations are in the 'All Servers' lists. The Quick Tasks section doesn't have a Play PUBG tile. There's no kill switch and no Settings menu (the Protocols list is now on the main screen). If you regularly use both the Windows and Mac apps, the differences could be a little confusing.The iOS app is all about simplicity, with no Settings menu, no kill switch, no P2P, no HTTPS protocol option, and absolutely no bonus privacy tools. Instead, you just get the location lists, a big Connect button and a choice of TCP/UDP protocols.There's good news in one iOS area. Cities are grouped into countries, making for a shorter and better-organized list. But it's still not sorted alphabetically (and to make it worse, the iOS app uses a different order to the Windows build).The Android app is essentially the iOS version with added split tunneling, and yet another sort order for the servers list. Not a big deal unless you're using iTop VPN on several platforms – only then will you need to remember where your favorite locations appear on each device.iTop VPN supports a kill switch to stop internet traffic if the VPN drops unexpectedly. We found the Windows app was mostly successful, but had some flaws. When we forcibly crashed the app, for instance, our VPN connection dropped, the kill switch didn't kick in, and our traffic was unprotected. And as the app doesn't raise any notifications, an affected user is unlikely to realize they're at risk in such a scenario.Split tunneling support allows you to decide which apps use the tunnel, and which don't. It's handy if you only need the VPN to unblock a couple of websites, say, as other apps can use your normal (and faster) connection. This worked well for us, directing only browsers through the VPN by default, but making it easy to add other apps as required.A DNS Protection feature claims to protect your DNS settings from modification by malware. You can also set your DNS to one of several public DNS providers, simply by choosing them from a list: Google, OpenDNS, Verizon, Comodo and DNS Advantage.The app has a handful of settings. You're able to launch it when Windows starts, optionally connect, and choose one of three protocol options: UDP, TCP and HTTPS. As iTop VPN doesn't use any standard VPN protocol, it's not completely clear what the effects of these settings might be, and the descriptions don't help much. (Choosing TCP apparently gets you 'high level privacy', for instance, while opting for UDP means faster speeds but 'more data usage for special occasions.')iTop VPN is also missing some of the more advanced settings we see with other apps. It won't automatically connect when you access insecure Wi-Fi, for example. There are no leak protection options, and we saw no way to control notifications.iTop VPN has some privacy and security extras that we've not seen with other VPNs.A Security Reinforce module scanned our PC for weak or non-standard security settings, then suggested appropriate changes. You'll need some technical knowledge to understand its report, but the advice looks good to us, and is likely to improve your system security.The Browser Privacy feature can check and clear your browsing tracks in Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Opera and even Internet Explorer.These tools aren't the best we've seen, and they're maybe not all suitable for a VPN. Most providers use their own DNS servers rather than OpenVPN or Google, for instance, as that ensures no one else gets to see the sites you visit.But there's also more power here than we expected. DNS Protection isn't something iTop VPN threw together in an afternoon, for instance – it's an IObit feature taken direct from IObit Malware Fighter. Put it all together and the extras could have some value for more experienced users. (Although, as with the main app interface, we'd be happier if the developer sorted out the core features before starting with piling on the extras.)iTop VPN apps have specialist locations for unblocking many platforms, making them far easier to use than many competitors. If you're looking to unblock a supported platform in the US, say, you don't have to start choosing US locations until you find one that works: just choose a service from the list and you're ready to go.We tried this with BBC iPlayer, often a tricky site to unblock, but iTop VPN got us access right away.iTop VPN has Disney Plus locations in New York and Los Angeles. They both worked for us.There are streaming locations for Amazon Prime in the US and UK, but we weren't so lucky with these. Amazon spotted what we were doing, displayed its 'your device is connected to the internet using a VPN or proxy service' and demanded we 'disable it and try again.'It was the same disappointing story with Netflix: iTop VPN has a couple of specialist Netflix servers (US and Korea) but neither worked for us.Getting us into two of our four test sites isn't bad, but other providers do much better. CyberGhost, ExpressVPN, Hide.me, Hola, PrivadoVPN, Private Internet Access, ProtonVPN and Surfshark all unblocked every one of our test platforms in recent reviews.We measured iTop VPN speeds from US and UK locations with a 1Gbps connection in both cases, using several performance testing sites and services (SpeedTest's website and command line app, nPerf, SpeedOfme and more). We checked the download speeds at least five times from each site, and then we repeated all the tests in an evening session.UK download speeds were very ordinary at 180-190Mbps, but US performance was much better, with peak median speeds of around 360-400Mps, even reaching 900Mbps at one point. We're skeptical about that peak score, as it only happened in a single session out of the 20 we ran in the US, and none of the others got near even half that speed. We think the 360-400Mbps figure is more representative of what you're likely to see.That's not a bad result, and it's a close match with the OpenVPN performance we see from the likes of HideMyAss! (270-410Mbps) and TunnelBear (330-350Mbps).iTop's results lag well behind many other VPNs, though, especially when they're using WireGuard and faster protocols (providers such as CyberGhost, IPVanish and NordVPN regularly hit 750-900Mbps).There's another issue, too. That 330-350Mbps we saw from TunnelBear was using a standard OpenVPN connection with a very well-understood level of encryption and security. But iTop VPN uses the company's own custom protocol, which means we can't be sure these figures are a fair comparison. If iTop VPN is using more basic encryption, for instance, that might give it a big performance advantage, but at the cost of some security.iTop VPN has a stack of powerful extras, but it misses on a lot of the VPN fundamentals: there is no OpenVPN or WireGuard, limited unblocking, a flawed kill switch, plus various privacy issues. Its 700MB per day (21GB a month) free plan might be worth considering, but we wouldn't use it for anything privacy-critical.Mike began his career as a lead software developer in the engineering world, where his creations were used by big-name companies from Rolls Royce to British Nuclear Fuels and British Aerospace.

<title>Workable review | TechRadar</title>
<content>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more By Mike Jennings 12 November 2021 While Workable provides plenty of features for recruitment, many rivals go a bit further with their respective offerings.While Workable provides plenty of features for recruitment, many rivals go a bit further with their respective offerings.Workable is a dedicated recruitment platform and Applicant Tracking System and it doesn’t tie into a wider suite of HR products, so it’s got a focused and well-designed range of features.It’s not the cheapest recruitment solution around, though, so it’s going to have to impress if businesses are going to find room for Workable in their budgets.Workable’s features are divided into three strands – the first sources and attracts candidates, the second handles evaluation and interviews, and the third tackles hiring.Workable has one-click job posting to more than 200 job boards, and it integrates with your company’s social media channels so you can advertise your own vacancies. You can also use Workable’s own drag-and-drop system to build your corporate careers page, and job applications from various sources are collated into a single pipeline for easier management.Lots of the processes can be automated, too. Workable’s AI systems supply a list of up to 50 potential candidates when you post a new job – you don’t even have to wait for the resumes to roll in. This service can automatically create social adverts for your positions, and Workable’s Chrome extension can deliver in-depth candidate information based on their social media profiles.Recruiters can also use Workable’s powerful Boolean search options to find suitable candidates. Workable has internal application options and an employee referral platform that can include unique sharing links and referral rewards.Switch over to the evaluation and interview module, and you’ll find more helpful features. You can use more than 700 job description templates that are SEO-optimized, and you can customize your hiring pipeline for consistency and familiarity.The service supports two-way syncing with Gmail and Outlook accounts to help recruiters and candidates stay on the same page, and Workable has an app to allow staff to manage recruitment on the move. Elsewhere, you’ll find collaborative tools that can be used by your whole HR team and in-built support for video interviews, and you can automate candidate communication. Anonymized candidate screening enables more inclusive hiring, and you can assess candidates using skillset, personality, and cognitive ability tests – and then see all the data so you can make informed hiring decisions.Further automation streamlines the hiring process, and you can use a central workflow and timeline to keep staff abreast of hiring processes and budgets. Workable has built-in offer letters and electronic signatures, and Workable also supports national, international, and local regulations to help your company be fully compliant.Workable also integrates with software from Microsoft, Google, Facebook, and LinkedIn, and can also be used with HR tools from Glassdoor, Bamboo, and Indeed. Ultimately, there are dozens of third-party integrations here for products that handle video interviews, assessments, referrals, sourcing, and every other part of the recruitment process.Workable does have a broad range of features, but large companies may want more customization and abilities from an HR product that handles more than just the recruitment process. Workable also misses out on automated reference checking, and it doesn’t have any onboarding options beyond the ability to offer jobs to candidates.Workable’s software is divided into four different products. The Paygo option costs $99 per job posted per month, and it has Workable’s essential features but few of the advanced options – it’s billed as a self-service choice for companies that only hire occasionally.The Core, Growth, and Premier options supply added functionality – the Core option builds on the PayGo service, the Growth tier adds automation options and extra features alongside a dedicated account manager, and the Premier option unlocks every feature alongside bespoke onboarding for the service in your business.Workable doesn’t list the pricing for those three products, though. You’ll have to get in touch with the company and work out costs based on your company’s size and needs.Workable is a straightforward recruitment tool with a good range of features that deliver a well-balanced approach across the entire recruitment process.It’s particularly useful for small and medium-sized businesses who need recruitment software to integrate with other HR services they may use. Still, larger companies with their own HR staff or full-service third-party options may not find this dedicated product necessary.We've also featured the best recruitment platforms, best HR software and best background check servicesSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!Thank you for signing up to TechRadar.

<title>Host Europe web hosting review | TechRadar</title>
<content>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more By Mike Williams , Mirza Bahic 12 November 2021 Host Europe is a strong, stable, and feature-packed web hosting provider geared towards German-speaking customers. If you fall into this category, don’t hesitate to give them a chance.Host Europe is a strong, stable, and feature-packed web hosting provider geared towards German-speaking customers. If you fall into this category, don’t hesitate to give them a chance.Established in 1997 in Germany, Host Europe has become and remained rather successful since, continuing to offer web hosting solutions for individuals, small and medium-sized businesses. They say that their primary objective is to provide their customers with internet and server hosting with the highest quality possible. This rings true if we consider that they’ve collected more than a couple of rewards throughout the years.In the Readers' Choice Host Europe was voted as the best service provider of 2019, the second-best in 2020, and a second-best in the cloud hosting category. They were also awarded gold three times at the Hosting & Service Provider Summits and received other awards by HOSTtest.de and from the test portal CHIP for best-in-class accessibility.Host Europe was one among the brands of HEG (Host Europe Group), a web hosting, email, and domain name registrar giant founded in 1997, same as its subsidiary. In December 2016, HEG was acquired by GoDaddy, and its name is slowly being phased out if the news holds true. However, this shouldn’t impact Host Europe in any significant way.Host Europe is headquartered in Cologne and has two “energy-saving and secure” data centers in Cologne and Strasbourg. If you wish to find out more about these two, the “Technology” section on their website provides plenty of information on the matter.The official site of Host Europe looks and feels old-fashioned, although not necessarily in a bad way since it makes finding your way around rather simple. The site is available in German and English language and it features a good-looking blog, which, unfortunately, isn’t translated into English.You can find Host Europe on Facebook (which is in English although the articles linked there are often in German), and Twitter (which is openly exclusive to its German-speaking followers). Host Europe's solutions include shared hosting, WordPress hosting, ecommerce hosting, VPS, reseller hosting, and dedicated server hosting, as well as domain name registration, SSL certificates, backup storage, site security, Microsoft 365 tools, professional email, and a website builder.Although Host Europe's hosting plans are affordable in general, which of them you get to choose from depends on whether you want to pay on a monthly or an annual basis. The price is identical but if you want to commit for one month only you’ll also have to pay a €14.99 ($17.30) one-off setup fee.Regardless of the billing cycle, for €4.99 ($5.75) per month, the “Basic” plan will supply you with one annual domain, SSL, 50GB of storage space, two MySQL databases, one automated mailbox migration (included in the first 30 days), and Kaspersky virus protection. More expensive plans won’t add further features but increase the amount of storage space, the number of databases, and the number of antivirus software solutions.While Host Europe doesn’t offer a money-back guarantee, you can cancel your contract with them within four weeks.As for payment methods, Host Europe accepts all major credit cards, PayPal, and SEPA direct debit. To create an account with Host Europe you’ll have to provide your full name, phone number, email, and physical address, and think up a strong password. Here, you can choose whether you want to be contacted via email, phone, or both. Depending on your choice, you’ll receive an order confirmation via message or email together, containing extremely detailed explanations of the features you can expect to receive, the cancellation policy, and the General Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy.After adding your payment details and making a purchase, you’ll be transferred to Host Europe’s dashboard, which (unfortunately for non-German users) suffers from an incomplete translation to English. To be fair, most important information is fully translated to English, but there are still parts in German, including the FAQ section accessible through the dashboard.Since Host Europe is not the swiftest of providers, you may have to hang around for a while before finding out whether your order was accepted or not. If yes, you’ll still have to provide additional information about your order before you can start using the product you've purchased. As of late, Host Europe provides user-friendly cPanel with its Linux-based products, and Plesk is available with the Windows hosting packages - the two most popular control panels in the industry. As for website building, in addition to a whole variety of CMS options (WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, and so on), ecommerce apps (Magento, Blestan, OpenCart, and more), community building tools (phpBB, Booked, Dada Mail, and so forth) and other useful apps you can easily install via Installatron, you’ll also get a bare-bones version of a beginner-friendly website builder. To get more of everything (sites, webspace per site, templates, email accounts, and so forth) you’ll have to purchase one of the bigger website builder plans as an add-on. After putting Host Europe’s official site to the GTmetrix speed test, we got average results altogether. The time it took for the site to fully load was an amazing 1.3 seconds but all other vital speed measuring metrics (largest contentful paint, total blocking time, and cumulative layout shift) got trapped in the abyss of averageness pulling the final score down to B (74%).When it comes to uptime, Host Europe guarantees an availability of its data centers at 99.95% as a monthly mean, with the exclusion of scheduled (and unscheduled) maintenance windows. This can be translated into 4.5 hours of downtime annually, or about 10 minutes for two weeks.After monitoring the uptime of Host Europe's official site via UptimeRobot for two weeks, we recorded a worrying 55 minutes of downtime which dragged the total uptime to 99.76%, meaning that we should be getting some sweet credit as compensation.If you find yourself in need of a helping hand, you can try reaching Host Europe's team via email, fax, live chat, and, if you’re in a rush, around-the-clock telephone number. The toll-free numbers are available for users from Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, as well as the “order hotline” which is reachable Monday to Friday, from 9 AM to 5 PM. There is even Host Europe's postal address if you feel like writing them an old-fashioned letter and recalling the “old days”. Alternatively, you can browse their “Forms and documents” section for questions related to terms of service, and it is available both in English and German. There is also a well-equipped FAQ section (it’s closer to a knowledge base), but it still isn’t translated into English, which means all users who don’t understand German are left to fend for themselves. Unfortunately, there is no community forum as a final resort before reaching the support personnel. If you want a well-rounded host that will give you more than enough time to decide whether you want to stay with them or part your ways, HostGator may be worth a look. Besides offering an ample 45-day money-back guarantee, it is also geared towards English-speaking users making itself more attractive to an international market than Host Europe.Another US-based alternative to Host Europe is Bluehost, a host that is known for its pocket-friendly pricing and not particularly pocket-friendly price spike after the promotional period. Although with Host Europe there is a one-off setup fee with all monthly plans, at least you won’t have to worry about any sudden price spikes.If you are looking for a simple solution from Germany aimed at personal sites or small businesses, a Berlin-based Strato might be worth a try. Although their scope of hosting solution seems somewhat limited, all their plans support multiple-domain hosting, come with a free domain, a free SSL certificate, plenty of one-click installs, a website builder, and a 30-day “no quibble” money-back guarantee. Unlike Host Europe, Strato doesn’t offer a monthly billing option, although the one you get with Host Europe will set you back with a one-off setup fee.Hostinger is one of the most popular hosts from Europe. It offers its users an access to its servers which are found all around the world including the Americas, Europe, and Asia. Thanks to its 14-day “observation” period you can try out everything for yourselves without a need to worry about your budget. Unfortunately, you will not get such a chance with Host Europe.Host Europe is an award-winning veteran from Germany trusted by over 250.000 customers as we write, and the number keeps on growing. If you can come to terms with data centers in Germany and France (kind of), self-help options being in German only, somewhat sluggish sign-up procedure, and considerable one-off setup fees (with monthly plans), be sure to give Host Europe a chance. If not, HostGator or Bluehost might be a better choice. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!Thank you for signing up to TechRadar.

<title>FastVPN review | TechRadar</title>
<content>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more By Mike Williams 12 November 2021 Seriously cheap for the first year, but you can see why: the desktop apps are unreliable, and there are very features. For unblocking Netflix and basic tasks only.Seriously cheap for the first year, but you can see why: the desktop apps are unreliable, and there are very features. For unblocking Netflix and basic tasks only.FastVPN is a simple VPN owned by Namecheap, the popular domain registrar and web hosting service.If you're wondering why you should trust a domain registrar to run your VPN, good question. No need to worry, though; it's using servers run by an arm of StackPath, which has also provided the network for major VPN brands such as IPVanish and StrongVPN.Whoever owns the network, it's a decent size, with 1,000+ P2P-friendly servers spread across 75+ locations worldwide. Apps are available for Windows, Mac, iOS and Android; tutorials show how to set up the service on Linux and various routers, and, unusually, there are no annoying limits on the number of devices you can connect at one time.The feature list is basic, though, covering the bare essentials only. You get OpenVPN and IKEv2 protocol support (no WireGuard), secure DNS to reduce the chance of DNS leaks, a kill switch to block internet access if the VPN drops, and that's about it.FastVPN's starting prices are some of the lowest around, thanks to big discounts off your first term.Sign up for the monthly plan, for instance, and you'll pay nothing at all for the first month, effectively a 30-day free trial, rising to a still-excellent $5.88 on renewal.The annual plan is just $1 a month for year one, rising to $2.88 on renewal. There are no longer-term plans (the old three-year option has disappeared.)These are very low first-term prices (and they're pretty good on renewal, too). Private Internet Access is one of our go-to VPNs for value, but with monthly plans at $9.95, dropping to $3.33 paid annually, it's still no match for FastVPN.If you are tempted, you're able to by card or PayPal, and there's a 30-day money-back guarantee to protect you if it all goes wrong.The FastVPN website comments briefly on logging, saying you'll "keep your browsing activities to yourself with our strict no-log policy" and that the service "won’t track, collect, or share any of your logs". We searched the website for something more detailed, without any luck. The only extra information we found came from the Windows VPN app installer, which warned that it collected "aggregated anonymous app usage data, including your device and OS version so we can troubleshoot and improve our app", but "that's it", and that there's "no tracking of your personal identifiable information".We'd like a little more substance than that, and ideally a security or no-logging audit, but that doesn't seem likely to happen any time soon. FastVPN is targeted at the average consumer who wants something easy to use which 'just works', and not the kind of user who cares about session logging or whether it uses AES-256-CBC or GCM.FastVPN's Windows app opens with a default 'Best Available' server choice, and a 'Connect VPN' button. The client displays the name of your current network, too, a handy way to be sure you're connecting to the official coffee shop Wi-Fi, and not some shady open network nearby.A location picker to the left gives a list of countries (some with city-level choices), server load and ping time information (you can sort by those, too), simple Favorites system to easily group your most commonly used locations.Although this looked good in theory, real-world performance was poor. OpenVPN connections took up to 40 seconds, three to four times faster than we usually see, and IKEv2 connections were also poor at 18-20 seconds.That was just the start. Occasionally, after connecting, we found we couldn't access any websites. Sometimes the VPN dropped, complaining of various internal errors or that there was 'no network detected.' It didn't help that some of these error messages were layered on top of normal status information, making them difficult to read. Not a huge issue, but it all helps to create a poor impression of the app. We expect better from a big company such as Namecheap.Settings are relatively limited: auto-start options, a choice of protocol (IKEv2, OpenVPN TCP/ UDP, and a Scramble option to help bypass VPN blocking), and a kill switch to block internet access if the VPN drops.The app handled unexpected disconnects very well. We forcibly closed our IKEv2 connection, the app noticed, displayed a notification and reconnected at once. So, we closed the connection again, then kept closing it, as fast we could, interrupting every reconnect attempt. That's a level of stress testing which goes way beyond what you're likely to see in real life, but the app just waited until we'd finished, then reconnected as before.The kill switch generally worked well, too. Whatever we did to IKEv2 or OpenVPN connections, the app raised an alert, wasn't especially troubled by our extreme testing methods and reconnected as soon as it could, without ever leaving us unprotected. FastVPN's Android VPN app looks and feels very similar to the Windows edition: big green Connect button, by default you're connected to the nearest server, but you can choose something else from a searchable list of locations.We noticed small usability issues. The desktop app hides city locations by default, and they're only visible if you expand a specific country. The mobile app displays city and country names in the same list, so there's much more scrolling (and the cities aren't always displayed in alphabetical order, either.) Settings are basic, too, with protocol options reduced to OpenVPN UDP or TCP (no IKEv2, this time).FastVPN's iOS app is very similar, but does add one very useful feature. An Always On option enables automatically connecting to the VPN whenever you access untrusted networks, while also ignoring networks you know are safe (home, work, etc).These apps aren't bad, and they didn't have the technical issues we saw on the desktop. But they're also short on features, and can't begin to compete with the best VPNs.FastVPN doesn't make any specific claims about its website-unblocking abilities, but generally suggests it can help you 'securely unblock sites and content.'This certainly worked as a BBC iPlayer VPN, where FastVPN got us access with the first location we tried.The service scored an even big victory when it unblocked US Netflix, a task which defeats many big VPN names.But FastVPN couldn't keep up that level of success, and it failed with Amazon Prime Video and Disney+.That's not a bad result, but we've seen some providers do much better. CyberGhost, ExpressVPN, Hide.me, Private Internet Access, ProtonVPN and Surfshark all unblocked everything in their latest reviews.We measured FastVPN speeds from a UK data center with excellent connectivity and a 1Gbps connection, giving us room to see exactly what the service could do.FastVPN turned out to be not so fast after all, with both OpenVPN and IKEv2 speeds reaching a modest 250Mbps. That's better than some - NordVPN and IPVanish didn't reach 200Mbps with OpenVPN - but a long way behind OpenVPN leaders such as HideMyAss! (340-350Mbps), Hide.me (390Mbps) and ProtonVPN (400-460Mbps.)There's another problem. OpenVPN is the fastest protocol FastVPN supports, but most providers give you much more capable options. IPVanish's WireGuard connections hit 750-900Mbps in recent reviews, for instance, while NordVPN's NordLynx was a close match at 760-880Mbps.So despite the name, there's no chance this service will appear in our list of the truly fastest VPNs. But although FastVPN trails far behind in the speed stakes, it's also far from the worst we've seen, and the service should handle most browsing or streaming tasks with ease.FastVPN's ultra-low starter prices caught our eye, but the Windows app was unreliable and there are very few features. Could work as a cheap VPN for unblocking Netflix and other basic tasks, but this isn't the service for experienced or demanding users. Assuming you want something better, we'd suggest going for our #1 rated ExpressVPN or, to save on costs, the also brilliant Surfshark.Mike began his career as a lead software developer in the engineering world, where his creations were used by big-name companies from Rolls Royce to British Nuclear Fuels and British Aerospace. He now covers VPNs, antivirus and all things security for TechRadar, although he still has a secret love of quirky open-source and freeware apps which find brand new ways to solve common problems.Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!Thank you for signing up to TechRadar.

<title>Zoho Recruit review | TechRadar</title>
<content>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more By Mike Jennings 12 November 2021 Zoho Recruit offers excellent features that are easy to use though this recruitment tool can be expensive for smaller businesses.Zoho Recruit offers excellent features that are easy to use though this recruitment tool can be expensive for smaller businesses.Zoho Recruit is one of the biggest Applicant Tracking System (ATS) services in the world, so it’s going to be right at the top of most people’s lists if they need some help with their hunt for top-quality staff.There’s plenty going for Zoho Recruit, including a free option and a broad range of features. Still, we’ve also got questions about some of the firm’s support options and integration abilities.Zoho Recruit has a broad range of features that are divided into three kinds of product – one for companies, another for recruitment agencies and a third for people who need to hire temporary staff.The Corporate HR product allows you to post job openings to hundreds of different mainstream and niche job boards, and you can boost job listings on social networks. You can also search through resumes with AI-powered modules that will find candidates on your behalf. You can set up a dedicated resume inbox and invite recruiters to submit potential candidates through a portal with your own branding. You can also establish an employee referral portal to allow your existing staff to give recommendations.Zoho’s AI features are robust and impressive. Applicants can be graded in advance based on your preferred traits and requirements, and advanced searches help narrow down the candidate pool.You can use Zoho’s background screening module to run background checks so you can adhere to your preferred hiring practices, and you can ask candidates to complete pre-screening assessments to help eliminate unsuitable people and streamline the process.HR staff and candidates can access dedicated portals to track the status of applications, and Zoho allows you to track recruitment stats and analyze data. Thanks to a customized series of alerts, rules, and actions, corporate HR staff can also automate much of the recruitment process. Impressively, Zoho’s entire experience can be customized, from the branding and aesthetic of the software to custom tabs and layout options.Switch over to Zoho’s agency module, and you get the same features alongside options to have powerful client portals that allow agency clients to create vacancies easily, send feedback and invite people to interview. And if you use Zoho’s temporary staff product, you’ll receive help from straightforward and powerful scheduling and timesheet tools alongside electronic signatures and invoicing to speed up laborious parts of the process. Temporary workers can also access their own portal to mark their availability and view their workloads.Zoho does have good features, but some things are missing here too. Zoho Recruit has integrations with Outlook, LinkedIn, Google Suite, and a selection of other products and services, but you’ll find more integration ability elsewhere.This service doesn’t have as many behavioral, skill, and cognitive testing options as some other recruitment services, either. You only get 24/7 support if you pay extra, too – standard plans only have support five days of the week.Zoho’s broader company offers a full range of HR products, which is excellent if you want to pick and choose features or opt for a more comprehensive HR solution. Sadly, though, that means you don’t get onboarding unless you pay more.Zoho’s standard Corporate HR package costs $25 per month if you buy annually, and you get the service’s core features alongside candidate sourcing, resume management, tracking, and Google, Zoho, and Microsoft Outlook integrations. If you buy the $50 per month Enterprise product, you get AI-powered candidate matching, improvement portal management, and advanced customization. On top of that, you’ll need to pay extra for hiring manager and vendor portal licenses.Recruitment agencies can pay for $25, $50, and $75 tiers, with the two latter options adding extra features. That $50 choice adds AI matching, advanced analytics, better security control, portal management, and candidate assessment options. The top-tier service adds more customization and portal options.The temporary employee package has a simple, single price of $59 a month, although you’ll have to pay more if you want to hire more than 25 employees.Zoho Recruit’s three products also have free tiers that give you candidate management, interview scheduling, and simple resume search options alongside other basic features. Still, these options are restrictive – HR departments can only list one vacancy at a time, and the temporary staff package is limited to five people.Zoho Recruit has an impressive selection of features, no matter which package you choose. It doesn’t require a huge amount of technical knowledge to use and excels when it comes to customization and AI-powered extras. It offers a broad slate of recruitment options for HR departments, temporary staff needs, and agencies, and it can be easily incorporated into a wider HR product if necessary.The costs can mount up, especially if you want a full HR or recruitment solution, and you may want to look elsewhere if you need more testing options, extension integration, or better support.For most companies and agencies, though, Zoho Recruit will prove excellent, and is one of the recruitment services you need to consider.We've also featured the best recruitment platforms, best HR software and best background check servicesSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!Thank you for signing up to TechRadar.

<title>iTop VPN | TechRadar</title>
<content>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more By Mike Williams 12 November 2021 iTop VPN's generous 700MB/day (21GB/month) free plan might be worth a look for simple, non-privacy-critical tasks, but the service has too many fundamental issues to justify handing over your cash.iTop VPN's generous 700MB/day (21GB/month) free plan might be worth a look for simple, non-privacy-critical tasks, but the service has too many fundamental issues to justify handing over your cash.iTop VPN is a free VPN service with an affordable paid plan and one or two unusual privacy extras.The free plan gives you 700MB of data per day (21GB per month), and a choice of 16 locations (including the US and UK), easily beating most of the competition.Paying for a subscription gets you access to 100+ locations and 1,800+ streaming and gaming-optimized servers. (P2P is supported, too, though only on a handful of specialist servers.)A longer-than-usual list of bonus features include split tunneling, along with ad, tracker and malware blocking, browser history cleaning, and a Security Reinforce tool checks your device privacy settings and warns of any problems.iTop VPN has apps for Windows, Mac (a recent addition), Android and iOS, and support for connecting up to five devices simultaneously.This VPN's monthly plan is priced at $11.99, not the highest we've seen, but more expensive than most.Paying six months upfront cuts the cost to $6.99 a month, but that's still above average. You're paying iTop $41.94 to get your six months of cover, for instance, but Private Internet Access only asks $39.95 for a full year ($3.33 a month).iTop isn't done yet, though. Opt for its annual plan and you'll get an extra year thrown in, giving you two year's protection for $2.31 a month. A handful of providers are even cheaper – Private Internet Access has a three-year plan for $2.19 a month, Ivacy and PrivadoVPN go even lower – but that still looks like a real bargain.iTop supports payments via card, PayPal and bank transfers. It's good to see that you can turn off auto-renewal when you purchase the service, too, ensuring you won't accidentally pay for a second term that you don't want.Even better, if you're unhappy, a 15-day 'no questions asked' money-back guarantee (7 days for monthly-billed plans) means you're able to get your first payment back, too.Most VPNs protect your privacy by using secure VPN protocols such as WireGuard and OpenVPN. This doesn't guarantee you'll be safe – a provider can easily make mistakes in how they're set up – but they're open source, so anyone can see how they work or check the code for problems.However, iTop uses a custom scheme of its own. The Windows app appears to make a fast proxy connection to the VPN server, then uses an open source package called WinDivert to direct your traffic through the tunnel, apparently encrypting it with iTop's own protocol.Maybe this is secure, maybe it's not, but the company doesn't provide enough information to judge. You can't check the encryption it uses, for instance.We noticed a separate privacy issue on the iTop VPN website. Its SSL certificate wasn't properly configured, and this allowed us to access areas of the site, including the Login page, using an unencrypted HTTP connection. Unless you're using the VPN, that risks exposing your credentials to snoopers.iTop scores another privacy thumbs-down for its order form, where it insisted we entered our full name, city and post or ZIP code. A tooltip tried to justify this by saying that the details 'allow us to contact you if there are any issues with your order.' Uh, isn't that what our email address is for?iTop VPN claims to have a no logging policy, and the privacy policy spells out what this means.The company does its best to sound reassuring, telling users: 'We do not log your activity while you are utilizing the Services, including your browsing history, the bandwidth you used, or how long you connected to VPN servers. We do not store your original IP address or the server IP address that you connect to.'Sounds good, but we already know this can't be entirely true. iTop VPN limits its free plan to 700MB a day, so to make this work it must log the bandwidth you use and associate it with a device ID.Scroll down the page and you'll find a 'What information we collect' section, which could also include a lot of data: '...operating system, device ID, Internet protocol addresses, browser type, browser language, referring/exit pages, clickstream data of our websites and our products or services, and the pages or features of our software or services accessed by you and the time spent there.'Some of that looks like it's referring to the website, not iTop's apps, but the fact that we're left to guess is a problem. A privacy policy should be clear and precise, not leave us with more questions than it answers.Whatever you think of iTop VPN's claims, the real problem here is the company hasn't had them confirmed by any kind of security or logging audit. We're left to take iTop on trust, and hope the firm is delivering what it promises.iTop VPN's apps look good and are stuffed with features, but also score poorly on many of the usability fundamentals.Hitting a big red Connect button should by default automatically connect you to the nearest server, for instance. But even though we were testing from the UK, the free app regularly connected us to Japan, and the paid plan sometimes chose Germany.An 'All Servers' list enables switching to another location, but this also isn't as easy as it should be. For example, the countries aren't sorted by name, continent, distance or any other order we could recognize (there are sequences like Korea, Russia, UK, Italy, Singapore and so on). And there's no Favorites system or Recently Used lists to help out.The app is missing some usability shortcuts we commonly see elsewhere. You can't double click a location name to connect, for instance – you must click a location's Connect button, instead. When the app does connect (or disconnect), there's no notification to alert you, so you won't know whether you're protected unless you keep an eye on the app interface.On the plus side, you get separate Streaming, Social and Gaming lists where you can view locations optimized for specific platforms (PUBG, Warzone, Netflix, Disney Plus, Amazon Prime, iPlayer, Hulu and more).Too much scrolling? The Quick Access pane lists 17 common reasons for using a VPN: Browse Privacy, Hide Location, Watch Netflix, Play PUBG, Unblock WhatsApp (or Telegram, Facebook, Twitter etc), and more. If you're looking to unblock Netflix, there's no need to scan down a lengthy list of servers and try to guess which is best: just tap 'Watch Netflix' and the app automatically chooses a location for you.These work well, and we like the flexibility. But we'd prefer iTop VPN to sort out some of the interface basics before it layers on any more extras.iTop VPN's Mac app mostly looks like the Windows build, but with a few very noticeable changes.There's no Downloading section, for instance – the P2P locations are in the 'All Servers' lists. The Quick Tasks section doesn't have a Play PUBG tile. There's no kill switch and no Settings menu (the Protocols list is now on the main screen). If you regularly use both the Windows and Mac apps, the differences could be a little confusing.The iOS app is all about simplicity, with no Settings menu, no kill switch, no P2P, no HTTPS protocol option, and absolutely no bonus privacy tools. Instead, you just get the location lists, a big Connect button and a choice of TCP/UDP protocols.There's good news in one iOS area. Cities are grouped into countries, making for a shorter and better-organized list. But it's still not sorted alphabetically (and to make it worse, the iOS app uses a different order to the Windows build).The Android app is essentially the iOS version with added split tunneling, and yet another sort order for the servers list. Not a big deal unless you're using iTop VPN on several platforms – only then will you need to remember where your favorite locations appear on each device.iTop VPN supports a kill switch to stop internet traffic if the VPN drops unexpectedly. We found the Windows app was mostly successful, but had some flaws. When we forcibly crashed the app, for instance, our VPN connection dropped, the kill switch didn't kick in, and our traffic was unprotected. And as the app doesn't raise any notifications, an affected user is unlikely to realize they're at risk in such a scenario.Split tunneling support allows you to decide which apps use the tunnel, and which don't. It's handy if you only need the VPN to unblock a couple of websites, say, as other apps can use your normal (and faster) connection. This worked well for us, directing only browsers through the VPN by default, but making it easy to add other apps as required.A DNS Protection feature claims to protect your DNS settings from modification by malware. You can also set your DNS to one of several public DNS providers, simply by choosing them from a list: Google, OpenDNS, Verizon, Comodo and DNS Advantage.The app has a handful of settings. You're able to launch it when Windows starts, optionally connect, and choose one of three protocol options: UDP, TCP and HTTPS. As iTop VPN doesn't use any standard VPN protocol, it's not completely clear what the effects of these settings might be, and the descriptions don't help much. (Choosing TCP apparently gets you 'high level privacy', for instance, while opting for UDP means faster speeds but 'more data usage for special occasions.')iTop VPN is also missing some of the more advanced settings we see with other apps. It won't automatically connect when you access insecure Wi-Fi, for example. There are no leak protection options, and we saw no way to control notifications.iTop VPN has some privacy and security extras that we've not seen with other VPNs.A Security Reinforce module scanned our PC for weak or non-standard security settings, then suggested appropriate changes. You'll need some technical knowledge to understand its report, but the advice looks good to us, and is likely to improve your system security.The Browser Privacy feature can check and clear your browsing tracks in Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Opera and even Internet Explorer.These tools aren't the best we've seen, and they're maybe not all suitable for a VPN. Most providers use their own DNS servers rather than OpenVPN or Google, for instance, as that ensures no one else gets to see the sites you visit.But there's also more power here than we expected. DNS Protection isn't something iTop VPN threw together in an afternoon, for instance – it's an IObit feature taken direct from IObit Malware Fighter. Put it all together and the extras could have some value for more experienced users. (Although, as with the main app interface, we'd be happier if the developer sorted out the core features before starting with piling on the extras.)iTop VPN apps have specialist locations for unblocking many platforms, making them far easier to use than many competitors. If you're looking to unblock a supported platform in the US, say, you don't have to start choosing US locations until you find one that works: just choose a service from the list and you're ready to go.We tried this with BBC iPlayer, often a tricky site to unblock, but iTop VPN got us access right away.iTop VPN has Disney Plus locations in New York and Los Angeles. They both worked for us.There are streaming locations for Amazon Prime in the US and UK, but we weren't so lucky with these. Amazon spotted what we were doing, displayed its 'your device is connected to the internet using a VPN or proxy service' and demanded we 'disable it and try again.'It was the same disappointing story with Netflix: iTop VPN has a couple of specialist Netflix servers (US and Korea) but neither worked for us.Getting us into two of our four test sites isn't bad, but other providers do much better. CyberGhost, ExpressVPN, Hide.me, Hola, PrivadoVPN, Private Internet Access, ProtonVPN and Surfshark all unblocked every one of our test platforms in recent reviews.We measured iTop VPN speeds from US and UK locations with a 1Gbps connection in both cases, using several performance testing sites and services (SpeedTest's website and command line app, nPerf, SpeedOfme and more). We checked the download speeds at least five times from each site, and then we repeated all the tests in an evening session.UK download speeds were very ordinary at 180-190Mbps, but US performance was much better, with peak median speeds of around 360-400Mps, even reaching 900Mbps at one point. We're skeptical about that peak score, as it only happened in a single session out of the 20 we ran in the US, and none of the others got near even half that speed. We think the 360-400Mbps figure is more representative of what you're likely to see.That's not a bad result, and it's a close match with the OpenVPN performance we see from the likes of HideMyAss! (270-410Mbps) and TunnelBear (330-350Mbps).iTop's results lag well behind many other VPNs, though, especially when they're using WireGuard and faster protocols (providers such as CyberGhost, IPVanish and NordVPN regularly hit 750-900Mbps).There's another issue, too. That 330-350Mbps we saw from TunnelBear was using a standard OpenVPN connection with a very well-understood level of encryption and security. But iTop VPN uses the company's own custom protocol, which means we can't be sure these figures are a fair comparison. If iTop VPN is using more basic encryption, for instance, that might give it a big performance advantage, but at the cost of some security.iTop VPN has a stack of powerful extras, but it misses on a lot of the VPN fundamentals: there is no OpenVPN or WireGuard, limited unblocking, a flawed kill switch, plus various privacy issues. Its 700MB per day (21GB a month) free plan might be worth considering, but we wouldn't use it for anything privacy-critical.Mike began his career as a lead software developer in the engineering world, where his creations were used by big-name companies from Rolls Royce to British Nuclear Fuels and British Aerospace.

<title>Workable review | TechRadar</title>
<content>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more By Mike Jennings 12 November 2021 While Workable provides plenty of features for recruitment, many rivals go a bit further with their respective offerings.While Workable provides plenty of features for recruitment, many rivals go a bit further with their respective offerings.Workable is a dedicated recruitment platform and Applicant Tracking System and it doesn’t tie into a wider suite of HR products, so it’s got a focused and well-designed range of features.It’s not the cheapest recruitment solution around, though, so it’s going to have to impress if businesses are going to find room for Workable in their budgets.Workable’s features are divided into three strands – the first sources and attracts candidates, the second handles evaluation and interviews, and the third tackles hiring.Workable has one-click job posting to more than 200 job boards, and it integrates with your company’s social media channels so you can advertise your own vacancies. You can also use Workable’s own drag-and-drop system to build your corporate careers page, and job applications from various sources are collated into a single pipeline for easier management.Lots of the processes can be automated, too. Workable’s AI systems supply a list of up to 50 potential candidates when you post a new job – you don’t even have to wait for the resumes to roll in. This service can automatically create social adverts for your positions, and Workable’s Chrome extension can deliver in-depth candidate information based on their social media profiles.Recruiters can also use Workable’s powerful Boolean search options to find suitable candidates. Workable has internal application options and an employee referral platform that can include unique sharing links and referral rewards.Switch over to the evaluation and interview module, and you’ll find more helpful features. You can use more than 700 job description templates that are SEO-optimized, and you can customize your hiring pipeline for consistency and familiarity.The service supports two-way syncing with Gmail and Outlook accounts to help recruiters and candidates stay on the same page, and Workable has an app to allow staff to manage recruitment on the move. Elsewhere, you’ll find collaborative tools that can be used by your whole HR team and in-built support for video interviews, and you can automate candidate communication. Anonymized candidate screening enables more inclusive hiring, and you can assess candidates using skillset, personality, and cognitive ability tests – and then see all the data so you can make informed hiring decisions.Further automation streamlines the hiring process, and you can use a central workflow and timeline to keep staff abreast of hiring processes and budgets. Workable has built-in offer letters and electronic signatures, and Workable also supports national, international, and local regulations to help your company be fully compliant.Workable also integrates with software from Microsoft, Google, Facebook, and LinkedIn, and can also be used with HR tools from Glassdoor, Bamboo, and Indeed. Ultimately, there are dozens of third-party integrations here for products that handle video interviews, assessments, referrals, sourcing, and every other part of the recruitment process.Workable does have a broad range of features, but large companies may want more customization and abilities from an HR product that handles more than just the recruitment process. Workable also misses out on automated reference checking, and it doesn’t have any onboarding options beyond the ability to offer jobs to candidates.Workable’s software is divided into four different products. The Paygo option costs $99 per job posted per month, and it has Workable’s essential features but few of the advanced options – it’s billed as a self-service choice for companies that only hire occasionally.The Core, Growth, and Premier options supply added functionality – the Core option builds on the PayGo service, the Growth tier adds automation options and extra features alongside a dedicated account manager, and the Premier option unlocks every feature alongside bespoke onboarding for the service in your business.Workable doesn’t list the pricing for those three products, though. You’ll have to get in touch with the company and work out costs based on your company’s size and needs.Workable is a straightforward recruitment tool with a good range of features that deliver a well-balanced approach across the entire recruitment process.It’s particularly useful for small and medium-sized businesses who need recruitment software to integrate with other HR services they may use. Still, larger companies with their own HR staff or full-service third-party options may not find this dedicated product necessary.We've also featured the best recruitment platforms, best HR software and best background check servicesSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!Thank you for signing up to TechRadar.

<title>Host Europe web hosting review | TechRadar</title>
<content>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more By Mike Williams , Mirza Bahic 12 November 2021 Host Europe is a strong, stable, and feature-packed web hosting provider geared towards German-speaking customers. If you fall into this category, don’t hesitate to give them a chance.Host Europe is a strong, stable, and feature-packed web hosting provider geared towards German-speaking customers. If you fall into this category, don’t hesitate to give them a chance.Established in 1997 in Germany, Host Europe has become and remained rather successful since, continuing to offer web hosting solutions for individuals, small and medium-sized businesses. They say that their primary objective is to provide their customers with internet and server hosting with the highest quality possible. This rings true if we consider that they’ve collected more than a couple of rewards throughout the years.In the Readers' Choice Host Europe was voted as the best service provider of 2019, the second-best in 2020, and a second-best in the cloud hosting category. They were also awarded gold three times at the Hosting & Service Provider Summits and received other awards by HOSTtest.de and from the test portal CHIP for best-in-class accessibility.Host Europe was one among the brands of HEG (Host Europe Group), a web hosting, email, and domain name registrar giant founded in 1997, same as its subsidiary. In December 2016, HEG was acquired by GoDaddy, and its name is slowly being phased out if the news holds true. However, this shouldn’t impact Host Europe in any significant way.Host Europe is headquartered in Cologne and has two “energy-saving and secure” data centers in Cologne and Strasbourg. If you wish to find out more about these two, the “Technology” section on their website provides plenty of information on the matter.The official site of Host Europe looks and feels old-fashioned, although not necessarily in a bad way since it makes finding your way around rather simple. The site is available in German and English language and it features a good-looking blog, which, unfortunately, isn’t translated into English.You can find Host Europe on Facebook (which is in English although the articles linked there are often in German), and Twitter (which is openly exclusive to its German-speaking followers). Host Europe's solutions include shared hosting, WordPress hosting, ecommerce hosting, VPS, reseller hosting, and dedicated server hosting, as well as domain name registration, SSL certificates, backup storage, site security, Microsoft 365 tools, professional email, and a website builder.Although Host Europe's hosting plans are affordable in general, which of them you get to choose from depends on whether you want to pay on a monthly or an annual basis. The price is identical but if you want to commit for one month only you’ll also have to pay a €14.99 ($17.30) one-off setup fee.Regardless of the billing cycle, for €4.99 ($5.75) per month, the “Basic” plan will supply you with one annual domain, SSL, 50GB of storage space, two MySQL databases, one automated mailbox migration (included in the first 30 days), and Kaspersky virus protection. More expensive plans won’t add further features but increase the amount of storage space, the number of databases, and the number of antivirus software solutions.While Host Europe doesn’t offer a money-back guarantee, you can cancel your contract with them within four weeks.As for payment methods, Host Europe accepts all major credit cards, PayPal, and SEPA direct debit. To create an account with Host Europe you’ll have to provide your full name, phone number, email, and physical address, and think up a strong password. Here, you can choose whether you want to be contacted via email, phone, or both. Depending on your choice, you’ll receive an order confirmation via message or email together, containing extremely detailed explanations of the features you can expect to receive, the cancellation policy, and the General Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy.After adding your payment details and making a purchase, you’ll be transferred to Host Europe’s dashboard, which (unfortunately for non-German users) suffers from an incomplete translation to English. To be fair, most important information is fully translated to English, but there are still parts in German, including the FAQ section accessible through the dashboard.Since Host Europe is not the swiftest of providers, you may have to hang around for a while before finding out whether your order was accepted or not. If yes, you’ll still have to provide additional information about your order before you can start using the product you've purchased. As of late, Host Europe provides user-friendly cPanel with its Linux-based products, and Plesk is available with the Windows hosting packages - the two most popular control panels in the industry. As for website building, in addition to a whole variety of CMS options (WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, and so on), ecommerce apps (Magento, Blestan, OpenCart, and more), community building tools (phpBB, Booked, Dada Mail, and so forth) and other useful apps you can easily install via Installatron, you’ll also get a bare-bones version of a beginner-friendly website builder. To get more of everything (sites, webspace per site, templates, email accounts, and so forth) you’ll have to purchase one of the bigger website builder plans as an add-on. After putting Host Europe’s official site to the GTmetrix speed test, we got average results altogether. The time it took for the site to fully load was an amazing 1.3 seconds but all other vital speed measuring metrics (largest contentful paint, total blocking time, and cumulative layout shift) got trapped in the abyss of averageness pulling the final score down to B (74%).When it comes to uptime, Host Europe guarantees an availability of its data centers at 99.95% as a monthly mean, with the exclusion of scheduled (and unscheduled) maintenance windows. This can be translated into 4.5 hours of downtime annually, or about 10 minutes for two weeks.After monitoring the uptime of Host Europe's official site via UptimeRobot for two weeks, we recorded a worrying 55 minutes of downtime which dragged the total uptime to 99.76%, meaning that we should be getting some sweet credit as compensation.If you find yourself in need of a helping hand, you can try reaching Host Europe's team via email, fax, live chat, and, if you’re in a rush, around-the-clock telephone number. The toll-free numbers are available for users from Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, as well as the “order hotline” which is reachable Monday to Friday, from 9 AM to 5 PM. There is even Host Europe's postal address if you feel like writing them an old-fashioned letter and recalling the “old days”. Alternatively, you can browse their “Forms and documents” section for questions related to terms of service, and it is available both in English and German. There is also a well-equipped FAQ section (it’s closer to a knowledge base), but it still isn’t translated into English, which means all users who don’t understand German are left to fend for themselves. Unfortunately, there is no community forum as a final resort before reaching the support personnel. If you want a well-rounded host that will give you more than enough time to decide whether you want to stay with them or part your ways, HostGator may be worth a look. Besides offering an ample 45-day money-back guarantee, it is also geared towards English-speaking users making itself more attractive to an international market than Host Europe.Another US-based alternative to Host Europe is Bluehost, a host that is known for its pocket-friendly pricing and not particularly pocket-friendly price spike after the promotional period. Although with Host Europe there is a one-off setup fee with all monthly plans, at least you won’t have to worry about any sudden price spikes.If you are looking for a simple solution from Germany aimed at personal sites or small businesses, a Berlin-based Strato might be worth a try. Although their scope of hosting solution seems somewhat limited, all their plans support multiple-domain hosting, come with a free domain, a free SSL certificate, plenty of one-click installs, a website builder, and a 30-day “no quibble” money-back guarantee. Unlike Host Europe, Strato doesn’t offer a monthly billing option, although the one you get with Host Europe will set you back with a one-off setup fee.Hostinger is one of the most popular hosts from Europe. It offers its users an access to its servers which are found all around the world including the Americas, Europe, and Asia. Thanks to its 14-day “observation” period you can try out everything for yourselves without a need to worry about your budget. Unfortunately, you will not get such a chance with Host Europe.Host Europe is an award-winning veteran from Germany trusted by over 250.000 customers as we write, and the number keeps on growing. If you can come to terms with data centers in Germany and France (kind of), self-help options being in German only, somewhat sluggish sign-up procedure, and considerable one-off setup fees (with monthly plans), be sure to give Host Europe a chance. If not, HostGator or Bluehost might be a better choice. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!Thank you for signing up to TechRadar.

<title>Atlas VPN review | TechRadar</title>
<content>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more By Mike Williams 12 November 2021 Atlas VPN misses in some areas with its underpowered apps and feeble support site, but there's also plenty to like – it's P2P friendly, with great WireGuard-powered download speeds and no device limits for a very, very low price. Factor in the experience it'll gain after being acquired by NordVPN, and we think Atlas only gets better from.Atlas VPN misses in some areas with its underpowered apps and feeble support site, but there's also plenty to like – it's P2P friendly, with great WireGuard-powered download speeds and no device limits for a very, very low price. Factor in the experience it'll gain after being acquired by NordVPN, and we think Atlas only gets better from.Atlas VPN is a capable VPN provider which offers a decent all-round service for some of the lowest prices around.There's support for the speedy WireGuard protocol, for instance. You get apps for Windows, Mac, iOS and Android, a kill switch to protect you if the VPN drops, and the service allows unlimited simultaneous connections.A SafeSwap feature changes your IP address regularly while you're connected to the same server, maximizing your anonymity.Bonus features include ad and malware blocking, while data breach monitoring alerts you if any of your personal details are found on the dark web.Atlas VPN's network is smaller than many, with 700 servers spread across 27 countries. It'll be enough for many users, though, and P2P is supported everywhere.The really interesting news here came in October 2021, when Nord Security (the company behind NordVPN) announced it had acquired Atlas VPN. That tells you, all on its own, that Atlas isn't just another identikit VPN provider: there's some substance here, something worth buying. And although Atlas VPN will continue as an independent provider, it'll surely benefit in future from Nord Security's resources and experience.Atlas VPN's free no-registration-required plan gives you an easy way to try out the service, though with a couple of significant limits: 400MB per day for data, and three locations only (Amsterdam, New York, Los Angeles).That's not bad, and outperforms the free competition in some areas. Avira's Phantom VPN limits you to 500MB a month, for instance. Avast One's VPN has a generous 5GB a week data allowance, but doesn't support changing locations. ProtonVPN's free offering still wins out for its unlimited data and 12 locations.Opting for a paid plan drops the data and location limits. Prices start at an average $9.99 for monthly billing, and you can pay by card, PayPal and Google Pay. Upgrade to an annual account and the price plummets to just $2.49 a month, while the three-year plan is an amazing $1.39 a month (okay, only for the first term, and it's $3.99 on renewal, but that still looks like a good deal to us).Too good to be true? We'll check that later, but if you sign up and are unhappy, you're protected by a 30-day money-back guarantee.Beware, though: plans automatically renew when you sign up, and there's no way to change this or cancel your account from the control panel. You must email support and ask for help.Atlas VPN has the privacy basics covered with its WireGuard support, AES-256 encryption, kill switch and private DNS system.Unusual extras like rotating IP addresses along with ad and tracker-blocking should bring extra privacy protection.Atlas VPN's own policies aren't as impressive. Access its website for the first time and its cookie disclaimer only has an 'Accept' option, for instance. If you give the company your email address, you're opted in to receive marketing emails unless you specifically say otherwise. And the Blacklight Privacy Inspector found the site used Google Analytics, Facebook and assorted other tracking technologies.(Don't take our or Blacklight's word for it – even Atlas VPN's anti-tracker technology decided it was best to block three trackers on its own website.)Atlas VPN has been through what it calls an independent security audit, but this is just about as limited as we've seen.The exercise only covered the iOS app, for instance. It was a black box review, which means the auditors tested the functionality of the app, but didn't see the source code. And although Atlas VPN quoted some of the results in a blog post, it hasn't published the full report, so there's no way to judge it for ourselves.Okay, this is better than nothing, but only just, and it can't match the best of the competition. TunnelBear has annual audits of its apps, servers and backend infrastructure, for instance, and publishes the results for everyone to see.Atlas VPN claims to have a 'solid no-logs policy', saying 'we do not collect details on our users' activities, DNS queries, or other data that could be linked to our users.'The privacy policy says Atlas VPN's apps collect some device data, though. This includes: 'device type, model, brand name (e.g. Samsung, Apple), OS version, device ID, language, time zone, coarse location (city scale).'It also mentions using 'attribution analytics to track install source and traffic source', and 'advertising IDs to measure performance of our campaigns.'Put it all together and there's nothing to indicate Atlas VPN logs any of your online activities. It does have enough data to build user profiles, though, including details on user devices, when they connect and the amount of data they use. And as Atlas VPN hasn't had its no logging claims audited, there's no independent evidence to tell us if it's living up to its promises.The Windows app is basic, and covers only the VPN fundamentals: a location list of cities, a Connect/Disconnect button, and a handful of settings. (The latter consists of a 'Start on launch' option, an On/Off toggle for the kill switch, and a choice of WireGuard or IKEv2 protocols.)The developer hasn't paid much attention to usability. The location list covers cities, for instance, but they're not grouped by country or sorted in any order we could recognize. ('Germany, Serbia, USA - New Jersey, Hong Kong, Poland, Japan' is a part of the sequence – can you see any pattern?)There's no Favorites system or Recently Used list, either, so changing location is always going to require some scrolling.Our connection attempts failed sometimes with the free Atlas servers, perhaps a sign that they're overloaded. But this wasn't an issue once we upgraded, and connection times were decent at an average 5-6 seconds.Atlas claims its app has malware and ad blocking. There's no sign of this in the app itself, though, and it made no visible difference to us. We saw far better results by installing the free uBlock Origin.Our kill switch tests began with us simulating a dropped VPN. The good news is the kill switch immediately blocked our internet, ensuring we couldn't use the unprotected connection. The bad news – well, where to begin?The app didn't raise an alert when the VPN failed, for instance. It didn't try to reconnect, either. In a real-world situation you might easily waste time checking networks, rebooting your device, or even the router, before you figured out why your internet was down.Usually we could restore normal operations by hitting the Connect button. Sometimes this failed, though, with the app recommending we turned off the kill switch. What, it even blocked its own internet access? Really?We reluctantly agreed to turn the kill switch off, and the app then connected. But when we checked Settings, the kill switch was still marked as on – it hadn't been disabled, after all.Confused? Us too. Overall, the kill switch protected us from dropped connections, and that's what matters most. But the app could do a lot more to keep users informed, and get the VPN up and running again at the maximum possible speed.Desktop VPN apps normally beat their mobile VPN cousins for features, but not here. Atlas VPN's Android app outperforms its Windows offering in several areas.The location list works as expected, for instance, with countries grouped by continent and sorted alphabetically.There's a separate list of Streaming Servers, apparently optimized to reduce buffering, something not included on the desktop build.Settings are essentially the same as Windows, including a kill switch and support for WireGuard and IKEv2 protocols.An Assistant page hosts a tracker blocking feature and the Data Breach Monitor, more options that we couldn't find on Windows. We ran a quick check of these, and found they offered some value. Turning on tracker blocking protected us from some trackers, and entering an email into the Data Breach Monitor listed some of the breaches where our credentials were exposed.Atlas VPN's iOS app also improves on the Windows client with its sensibly sorted location list, tracker blocking and Data Breach Monitor options. It's a little short on features, though, with no WireGuard support or kill switch.Atlas VPN's support website is a little limited, and that's putting it politely. There are very few articles, most don't cover the topics you need, and many of what's left only have a few lines of content.The Troubleshooting section is a great example. We hoped to see some sound general advice on installation problems, issues with app features or download speeds. Instead, we found only four articles on very specific issues, such as 'How to fix error 13801 on Windows?' and 'What if my PC does not support Atlas VPN 64-bit?'(And if you're expecting any depth with the help provided, prepare for disappointment. This is the entire and unedited answer to that last question: 'No need to worry if your Windows device does not support Atlas VPN 64-bit: you can download the 32-bit version here.')Atlas VPN has no live chat support, but you can contact the company via email. We sent a message with a couple of simple product questions. Does the Windows app have tracker blocking? And which, if any of the apps block malicious websites or ads, as none of them mention it anywhere?A reply arrived just over two hours later, not bad for a response time.The message read: 'The mentioned features are currently being tested, therefore they are not available on all platforms. They should be rolled out to other OS'es soon, however, we are unable to provide an exact ETA as it may be misleading.'As Atlas VPN couldn't tell us which apps support malicious website or ad blocking, we'll assume the feature isn't available yet. That might have changed by the time you read this, but if it's a priority for you, ask the company before you sign up.Atlas VPN hadn't always impressed us so far, but it got off to a great unblocking start by getting us into BBC iPlayer.Accessing US Amazon was more difficult than usual, as it asked us to complete a CAPTCHA first. IP reputation service IPQualityScore revealed that our Atlas server IP address had a fraud rating of 100, with recent abuse reported. That's not anything directly to do with Atlas VPN, but it suggests the free plan and low prices might make the company especially appealing to hackers. That makes for more blacklisted IPs, and could mean more CAPTCHAS and other security hassles for you.Once we'd accessed US Amazon Prime, though, Atlas allowed us to stream content right away. We moved on to Disney Plus and were able to access that site, too.US Netflix is the jewel in the unblocking crown, though, and it was out of Atlas VPN's reach. We weren't able to view content from any of Atlas VPN's US servers.We measure VPN performance by running several benchmarking services – SpeedTest's website and command line app, SpeedOf.me, nPerf – from both a UK data center and a US residential location. We run each benchmark five times using WireGuard and OpenVPN (where available), run them a second time several hours later (that's a minimum of 120 tests), then analyze the data to see what's going on.Atlas VPN doesn't support OpenVPN, but its IKEv2 speeds were reasonable at a mid-range 260-320Mpps in the US, 170-210Mbps in the UK.Switching to WireGuard made a big difference, though, with speeds jumping to 590-600Mbps in the UK, and 650-800Mbps in the US. That's not quite a performance leader – NordVPN peaked at 880Mbps, IPVanish at 900Mbps – but it beat names like Windscribe (430-480Mbps), StrongVPN (450Mbps) and Surfshark (450-475Mbps).Atlas VPN may not have the best network, or apps, or support site – for those, you'd have to go for a more established provider like ExpressVPN. But now it's owned by Nord Security, we'd expect to see some improvements. And even right now, Atlas VPN's speeds are good, it unblocks more sites than many, and the three-year plan is as cheap as you'll see anywhere.Mike began his career as a lead software developer in the engineering world, where his creations were used by big-name companies from Rolls Royce to British Nuclear Fuels and British Aerospace.

Learn more By Stefan Ionescu 11 November 2021 Calendar.com is a long-standing name on the market for calendar apps, and its developers have put a lot of effort into making it a good, well-rounded solution. The interface is very light on the eyes and works smoothly, and the app itself offers lots of different features aimed at users with specific needs. It comes in several pricing tiers – including a free one – that allow users to pick the version that best matches their individual preferences. Calendar.com is a long-standing name on the market for calendar apps, and its developers have put a lot of effort into making it a good, well-rounded solution. The interface is very light on the eyes and works smoothly, and the app itself offers lots of different features aimed at users with specific needs. It comes in several pricing tiers – including a free one – that allow users to pick the version that best matches their individual preferences. If you’ve spent some time looking for a good calendar app, you’ve probably noticed that the market tends to be divided into two main categories. On one hand, we have apps aimed at individual users, offering a small but solid set of features that fit most needs. On the other hand, there are also the more advanced, professional calendar apps that offer lots of features and are designed to work best in large organizations.Calendar.com is a little bit of both, with features that can make it an attractive choice for regular home users, while also offering a competent professional package suitable for organizations of different sizes. The app is offered on multiple platforms as well, making it one of the most versatile offers on the market at the moment. Users can easily check out the free version and then upgrade to one of the premium tiers, and it doesn’t take long to set it up on different devices.There are three plans available – Free, Standard ($6/month), and Pro ($8/month). The free plan comes with pretty much everything one might need for regular daily use, and doesn’t lock any critical features behind a paywall, unlike some competing apps. Users on this tier can connect to one calendar on an external platform, and will have one basic workspace to use. It’s worth noting that up to five members can be added to a single workspace, even on a free tier, which makes the app better for collaboration for those who don’t want to pay for a premium solution.The two premium tiers add a variety of extra features aimed primarily at users in organizations. This includes the ability to sync more calendars under a single account, unlimited workspace members, meetings with 25 and even 50 guests, and analytics that can help you gain a deeper understanding of your scheduling habits. Calendar.com comes with all standard features you would expect to find in a modern calendar app. You can view your schedule in different modes – day/week/month/year, and can easily share your calendar with other users, including those on Google services. Free users can set up meetings with up to 5 attendants, and the app offers advanced scheduling options to help you find the best available timeslot.Some of the features offered by Calendar.com can’t be found in other similar apps, or at least not often – such as the ability to embed calendars in web pages, and the native Zapier integration. Zoom integration is available as well, though only on the premium tiers. For most individual users, this shouldn’t matter much, but for those planning to use Calendar.com in an organization, subscribing to one of the premium tiers will be a good idea. The interface of Calendar.com doesn’t shine with anything unusual, but it gets the job done more or less fine. The app leans towards a more minimalistic design, hiding elements that are not used frequently and focusing on the major parts of the interface. That said, you should find it very easy to dig up any feature you might need, and it doesn’t take long to get used to the way the interface is organized.The app does tend to flow a bit better with a premium subscription, mainly because it unlocks its full range of features. The free tier still has its benefits though – especially for those looking for simplicity and a clean design. Some users might find the additional features in the premium tiers confusing, since many of them are aimed at organizations and similar use cases. Give the free version a try before deciding to upgrade to a premium plan, as it might work just fine for your specific needs.The company provides standard email support on top of their help knowledge base, and they additionally offer some special options to premium subscribers. If you’re on the Standard or Pro tier, you can get in touch with support representatives over the phone, and your inquiries will be prioritized. Free users will still get support, but in a more limited capacity. Most of the problems you may encounter during your use of the app should already be covered in the knowledgebase in any case.Calendar.com manages to stand out with its set of features and pricing plans. The app faces direct competition from Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, and other popular solutions like Fantastical. It still has a dedicated user base, and some have been with it for many years at this point. Choosing between Calendar.com and some of its popular competitors is mostly about personal choice with regards to things like interface organization and pricing, and the app is definitely worth checking out if you’re currently comparing the different options on the market.The app does a great job on all fronts, and can be equally useful to individuals as well as large organizations. It takes some time to get used to how it works, but after that, everything is quite easy. The strong support it receives from its developers is nothing but a huge plus as well, so if you’re looking for a good calendar app that covers all important bases at a reasonable price, look no further.We've also featured the best calendar apps and best time management appsStefan has always been a lover of tech.

<title>FastVPN review | TechRadar</title>
<content>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more By Mike Williams 12 November 2021 Seriously cheap for the first year, but you can see why: the desktop apps are unreliable, and there are very features. For unblocking Netflix and basic tasks only.Seriously cheap for the first year, but you can see why: the desktop apps are unreliable, and there are very features. For unblocking Netflix and basic tasks only.FastVPN is a simple VPN owned by Namecheap, the popular domain registrar and web hosting service.If you're wondering why you should trust a domain registrar to run your VPN, good question. No need to worry, though; it's using servers run by an arm of StackPath, which has also provided the network for major VPN brands such as IPVanish and StrongVPN.Whoever owns the network, it's a decent size, with 1,000+ P2P-friendly servers spread across 75+ locations worldwide. Apps are available for Windows, Mac, iOS and Android; tutorials show how to set up the service on Linux and various routers, and, unusually, there are no annoying limits on the number of devices you can connect at one time.The feature list is basic, though, covering the bare essentials only. You get OpenVPN and IKEv2 protocol support (no WireGuard), secure DNS to reduce the chance of DNS leaks, a kill switch to block internet access if the VPN drops, and that's about it.FastVPN's starting prices are some of the lowest around, thanks to big discounts off your first term.Sign up for the monthly plan, for instance, and you'll pay nothing at all for the first month, effectively a 30-day free trial, rising to a still-excellent $5.88 on renewal.The annual plan is just $1 a month for year one, rising to $2.88 on renewal. There are no longer-term plans (the old three-year option has disappeared.)These are very low first-term prices (and they're pretty good on renewal, too). Private Internet Access is one of our go-to VPNs for value, but with monthly plans at $9.95, dropping to $3.33 paid annually, it's still no match for FastVPN.If you are tempted, you're able to by card or PayPal, and there's a 30-day money-back guarantee to protect you if it all goes wrong.The FastVPN website comments briefly on logging, saying you'll "keep your browsing activities to yourself with our strict no-log policy" and that the service "won’t track, collect, or share any of your logs". We searched the website for something more detailed, without any luck. The only extra information we found came from the Windows VPN app installer, which warned that it collected "aggregated anonymous app usage data, including your device and OS version so we can troubleshoot and improve our app", but "that's it", and that there's "no tracking of your personal identifiable information".We'd like a little more substance than that, and ideally a security or no-logging audit, but that doesn't seem likely to happen any time soon. FastVPN is targeted at the average consumer who wants something easy to use which 'just works', and not the kind of user who cares about session logging or whether it uses AES-256-CBC or GCM.FastVPN's Windows app opens with a default 'Best Available' server choice, and a 'Connect VPN' button. The client displays the name of your current network, too, a handy way to be sure you're connecting to the official coffee shop Wi-Fi, and not some shady open network nearby.A location picker to the left gives a list of countries (some with city-level choices), server load and ping time information (you can sort by those, too), simple Favorites system to easily group your most commonly used locations.Although this looked good in theory, real-world performance was poor. OpenVPN connections took up to 40 seconds, three to four times faster than we usually see, and IKEv2 connections were also poor at 18-20 seconds.That was just the start. Occasionally, after connecting, we found we couldn't access any websites. Sometimes the VPN dropped, complaining of various internal errors or that there was 'no network detected.' It didn't help that some of these error messages were layered on top of normal status information, making them difficult to read. Not a huge issue, but it all helps to create a poor impression of the app. We expect better from a big company such as Namecheap.Settings are relatively limited: auto-start options, a choice of protocol (IKEv2, OpenVPN TCP/ UDP, and a Scramble option to help bypass VPN blocking), and a kill switch to block internet access if the VPN drops.The app handled unexpected disconnects very well. We forcibly closed our IKEv2 connection, the app noticed, displayed a notification and reconnected at once. So, we closed the connection again, then kept closing it, as fast we could, interrupting every reconnect attempt. That's a level of stress testing which goes way beyond what you're likely to see in real life, but the app just waited until we'd finished, then reconnected as before.The kill switch generally worked well, too. Whatever we did to IKEv2 or OpenVPN connections, the app raised an alert, wasn't especially troubled by our extreme testing methods and reconnected as soon as it could, without ever leaving us unprotected. FastVPN's Android VPN app looks and feels very similar to the Windows edition: big green Connect button, by default you're connected to the nearest server, but you can choose something else from a searchable list of locations.We noticed small usability issues. The desktop app hides city locations by default, and they're only visible if you expand a specific country. The mobile app displays city and country names in the same list, so there's much more scrolling (and the cities aren't always displayed in alphabetical order, either.) Settings are basic, too, with protocol options reduced to OpenVPN UDP or TCP (no IKEv2, this time).FastVPN's iOS app is very similar, but does add one very useful feature. An Always On option enables automatically connecting to the VPN whenever you access untrusted networks, while also ignoring networks you know are safe (home, work, etc).These apps aren't bad, and they didn't have the technical issues we saw on the desktop. But they're also short on features, and can't begin to compete with the best VPNs.FastVPN doesn't make any specific claims about its website-unblocking abilities, but generally suggests it can help you 'securely unblock sites and content.'This certainly worked as a BBC iPlayer VPN, where FastVPN got us access with the first location we tried.The service scored an even big victory when it unblocked US Netflix, a task which defeats many big VPN names.But FastVPN couldn't keep up that level of success, and it failed with Amazon Prime Video and Disney+.That's not a bad result, but we've seen some providers do much better. CyberGhost, ExpressVPN, Hide.me, Private Internet Access, ProtonVPN and Surfshark all unblocked everything in their latest reviews.We measured FastVPN speeds from a UK data center with excellent connectivity and a 1Gbps connection, giving us room to see exactly what the service could do.FastVPN turned out to be not so fast after all, with both OpenVPN and IKEv2 speeds reaching a modest 250Mbps. That's better than some - NordVPN and IPVanish didn't reach 200Mbps with OpenVPN - but a long way behind OpenVPN leaders such as HideMyAss! (340-350Mbps), Hide.me (390Mbps) and ProtonVPN (400-460Mbps.)There's another problem. OpenVPN is the fastest protocol FastVPN supports, but most providers give you much more capable options. IPVanish's WireGuard connections hit 750-900Mbps in recent reviews, for instance, while NordVPN's NordLynx was a close match at 760-880Mbps.So despite the name, there's no chance this service will appear in our list of the truly fastest VPNs. But although FastVPN trails far behind in the speed stakes, it's also far from the worst we've seen, and the service should handle most browsing or streaming tasks with ease.FastVPN's ultra-low starter prices caught our eye, but the Windows app was unreliable and there are very few features. Could work as a cheap VPN for unblocking Netflix and other basic tasks, but this isn't the service for experienced or demanding users. Assuming you want something better, we'd suggest going for our #1 rated ExpressVPN or, to save on costs, the also brilliant Surfshark.Mike began his career as a lead software developer in the engineering world, where his creations were used by big-name companies from Rolls Royce to British Nuclear Fuels and British Aerospace.

<title>Zoho Recruit review | TechRadar</title>
<content>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more By Mike Jennings 12 November 2021 Zoho Recruit offers excellent features that are easy to use though this recruitment tool can be expensive for smaller businesses.Zoho Recruit offers excellent features that are easy to use though this recruitment tool can be expensive for smaller businesses.Zoho Recruit is one of the biggest Applicant Tracking System (ATS) services in the world, so it’s going to be right at the top of most people’s lists if they need some help with their hunt for top-quality staff.There’s plenty going for Zoho Recruit, including a free option and a broad range of features. Still, we’ve also got questions about some of the firm’s support options and integration abilities.Zoho Recruit has a broad range of features that are divided into three kinds of product – one for companies, another for recruitment agencies and a third for people who need to hire temporary staff.The Corporate HR product allows you to post job openings to hundreds of different mainstream and niche job boards, and you can boost job listings on social networks. You can also search through resumes with AI-powered modules that will find candidates on your behalf. You can set up a dedicated resume inbox and invite recruiters to submit potential candidates through a portal with your own branding. You can also establish an employee referral portal to allow your existing staff to give recommendations.Zoho’s AI features are robust and impressive. Applicants can be graded in advance based on your preferred traits and requirements, and advanced searches help narrow down the candidate pool.You can use Zoho’s background screening module to run background checks so you can adhere to your preferred hiring practices, and you can ask candidates to complete pre-screening assessments to help eliminate unsuitable people and streamline the process.HR staff and candidates can access dedicated portals to track the status of applications, and Zoho allows you to track recruitment stats and analyze data. Thanks to a customized series of alerts, rules, and actions, corporate HR staff can also automate much of the recruitment process. Impressively, Zoho’s entire experience can be customized, from the branding and aesthetic of the software to custom tabs and layout options.Switch over to Zoho’s agency module, and you get the same features alongside options to have powerful client portals that allow agency clients to create vacancies easily, send feedback and invite people to interview. And if you use Zoho’s temporary staff product, you’ll receive help from straightforward and powerful scheduling and timesheet tools alongside electronic signatures and invoicing to speed up laborious parts of the process. Temporary workers can also access their own portal to mark their availability and view their workloads.Zoho does have good features, but some things are missing here too. Zoho Recruit has integrations with Outlook, LinkedIn, Google Suite, and a selection of other products and services, but you’ll find more integration ability elsewhere.This service doesn’t have as many behavioral, skill, and cognitive testing options as some other recruitment services, either. You only get 24/7 support if you pay extra, too – standard plans only have support five days of the week.Zoho’s broader company offers a full range of HR products, which is excellent if you want to pick and choose features or opt for a more comprehensive HR solution. Sadly, though, that means you don’t get onboarding unless you pay more.Zoho’s standard Corporate HR package costs $25 per month if you buy annually, and you get the service’s core features alongside candidate sourcing, resume management, tracking, and Google, Zoho, and Microsoft Outlook integrations. If you buy the $50 per month Enterprise product, you get AI-powered candidate matching, improvement portal management, and advanced customization. On top of that, you’ll need to pay extra for hiring manager and vendor portal licenses.Recruitment agencies can pay for $25, $50, and $75 tiers, with the two latter options adding extra features. That $50 choice adds AI matching, advanced analytics, better security control, portal management, and candidate assessment options. The top-tier service adds more customization and portal options.The temporary employee package has a simple, single price of $59 a month, although you’ll have to pay more if you want to hire more than 25 employees.Zoho Recruit’s three products also have free tiers that give you candidate management, interview scheduling, and simple resume search options alongside other basic features. Still, these options are restrictive – HR departments can only list one vacancy at a time, and the temporary staff package is limited to five people.Zoho Recruit has an impressive selection of features, no matter which package you choose. It doesn’t require a huge amount of technical knowledge to use and excels when it comes to customization and AI-powered extras. It offers a broad slate of recruitment options for HR departments, temporary staff needs, and agencies, and it can be easily incorporated into a wider HR product if necessary.The costs can mount up, especially if you want a full HR or recruitment solution, and you may want to look elsewhere if you need more testing options, extension integration, or better support.For most companies and agencies, though, Zoho Recruit will prove excellent, and is one of the recruitment services you need to consider.We've also featured the best recruitment platforms, best HR software and best background check servicesSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!Thank you for signing up to TechRadar.

<title>iTop VPN | TechRadar</title>
<content>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more By Mike Williams 12 November 2021 iTop VPN's generous 700MB/day (21GB/month) free plan might be worth a look for simple, non-privacy-critical tasks, but the service has too many fundamental issues to justify handing over your cash.iTop VPN's generous 700MB/day (21GB/month) free plan might be worth a look for simple, non-privacy-critical tasks, but the service has too many fundamental issues to justify handing over your cash.iTop VPN is a free VPN service with an affordable paid plan and one or two unusual privacy extras.The free plan gives you 700MB of data per day (21GB per month), and a choice of 16 locations (including the US and UK), easily beating most of the competition.Paying for a subscription gets you access to 100+ locations and 1,800+ streaming and gaming-optimized servers. (P2P is supported, too, though only on a handful of specialist servers.)A longer-than-usual list of bonus features include split tunneling, along with ad, tracker and malware blocking, browser history cleaning, and a Security Reinforce tool checks your device privacy settings and warns of any problems.iTop VPN has apps for Windows, Mac (a recent addition), Android and iOS, and support for connecting up to five devices simultaneously.This VPN's monthly plan is priced at $11.99, not the highest we've seen, but more expensive than most.Paying six months upfront cuts the cost to $6.99 a month, but that's still above average. You're paying iTop $41.94 to get your six months of cover, for instance, but Private Internet Access only asks $39.95 for a full year ($3.33 a month).iTop isn't done yet, though. Opt for its annual plan and you'll get an extra year thrown in, giving you two year's protection for $2.31 a month. A handful of providers are even cheaper – Private Internet Access has a three-year plan for $2.19 a month, Ivacy and PrivadoVPN go even lower – but that still looks like a real bargain.iTop supports payments via card, PayPal and bank transfers. It's good to see that you can turn off auto-renewal when you purchase the service, too, ensuring you won't accidentally pay for a second term that you don't want.Even better, if you're unhappy, a 15-day 'no questions asked' money-back guarantee (7 days for monthly-billed plans) means you're able to get your first payment back, too.Most VPNs protect your privacy by using secure VPN protocols such as WireGuard and OpenVPN. This doesn't guarantee you'll be safe – a provider can easily make mistakes in how they're set up – but they're open source, so anyone can see how they work or check the code for problems.However, iTop uses a custom scheme of its own. The Windows app appears to make a fast proxy connection to the VPN server, then uses an open source package called WinDivert to direct your traffic through the tunnel, apparently encrypting it with iTop's own protocol.Maybe this is secure, maybe it's not, but the company doesn't provide enough information to judge. You can't check the encryption it uses, for instance.We noticed a separate privacy issue on the iTop VPN website. Its SSL certificate wasn't properly configured, and this allowed us to access areas of the site, including the Login page, using an unencrypted HTTP connection. Unless you're using the VPN, that risks exposing your credentials to snoopers.iTop scores another privacy thumbs-down for its order form, where it insisted we entered our full name, city and post or ZIP code. A tooltip tried to justify this by saying that the details 'allow us to contact you if there are any issues with your order.' Uh, isn't that what our email address is for?iTop VPN claims to have a no logging policy, and the privacy policy spells out what this means.The company does its best to sound reassuring, telling users: 'We do not log your activity while you are utilizing the Services, including your browsing history, the bandwidth you used, or how long you connected to VPN servers. We do not store your original IP address or the server IP address that you connect to.'Sounds good, but we already know this can't be entirely true. iTop VPN limits its free plan to 700MB a day, so to make this work it must log the bandwidth you use and associate it with a device ID.Scroll down the page and you'll find a 'What information we collect' section, which could also include a lot of data: '...operating system, device ID, Internet protocol addresses, browser type, browser language, referring/exit pages, clickstream data of our websites and our products or services, and the pages or features of our software or services accessed by you and the time spent there.'Some of that looks like it's referring to the website, not iTop's apps, but the fact that we're left to guess is a problem. A privacy policy should be clear and precise, not leave us with more questions than it answers.Whatever you think of iTop VPN's claims, the real problem here is the company hasn't had them confirmed by any kind of security or logging audit. We're left to take iTop on trust, and hope the firm is delivering what it promises.iTop VPN's apps look good and are stuffed with features, but also score poorly on many of the usability fundamentals.Hitting a big red Connect button should by default automatically connect you to the nearest server, for instance. But even though we were testing from the UK, the free app regularly connected us to Japan, and the paid plan sometimes chose Germany.An 'All Servers' list enables switching to another location, but this also isn't as easy as it should be. For example, the countries aren't sorted by name, continent, distance or any other order we could recognize (there are sequences like Korea, Russia, UK, Italy, Singapore and so on). And there's no Favorites system or Recently Used lists to help out.The app is missing some usability shortcuts we commonly see elsewhere. You can't double click a location name to connect, for instance – you must click a location's Connect button, instead. When the app does connect (or disconnect), there's no notification to alert you, so you won't know whether you're protected unless you keep an eye on the app interface.On the plus side, you get separate Streaming, Social and Gaming lists where you can view locations optimized for specific platforms (PUBG, Warzone, Netflix, Disney Plus, Amazon Prime, iPlayer, Hulu and more).Too much scrolling? The Quick Access pane lists 17 common reasons for using a VPN: Browse Privacy, Hide Location, Watch Netflix, Play PUBG, Unblock WhatsApp (or Telegram, Facebook, Twitter etc), and more. If you're looking to unblock Netflix, there's no need to scan down a lengthy list of servers and try to guess which is best: just tap 'Watch Netflix' and the app automatically chooses a location for you.These work well, and we like the flexibility. But we'd prefer iTop VPN to sort out some of the interface basics before it layers on any more extras.iTop VPN's Mac app mostly looks like the Windows build, but with a few very noticeable changes.There's no Downloading section, for instance – the P2P locations are in the 'All Servers' lists. The Quick Tasks section doesn't have a Play PUBG tile. There's no kill switch and no Settings menu (the Protocols list is now on the main screen). If you regularly use both the Windows and Mac apps, the differences could be a little confusing.The iOS app is all about simplicity, with no Settings menu, no kill switch, no P2P, no HTTPS protocol option, and absolutely no bonus privacy tools. Instead, you just get the location lists, a big Connect button and a choice of TCP/UDP protocols.There's good news in one iOS area. Cities are grouped into countries, making for a shorter and better-organized list. But it's still not sorted alphabetically (and to make it worse, the iOS app uses a different order to the Windows build).The Android app is essentially the iOS version with added split tunneling, and yet another sort order for the servers list. Not a big deal unless you're using iTop VPN on several platforms – only then will you need to remember where your favorite locations appear on each device.iTop VPN supports a kill switch to stop internet traffic if the VPN drops unexpectedly. We found the Windows app was mostly successful, but had some flaws. When we forcibly crashed the app, for instance, our VPN connection dropped, the kill switch didn't kick in, and our traffic was unprotected. And as the app doesn't raise any notifications, an affected user is unlikely to realize they're at risk in such a scenario.Split tunneling support allows you to decide which apps use the tunnel, and which don't. It's handy if you only need the VPN to unblock a couple of websites, say, as other apps can use your normal (and faster) connection. This worked well for us, directing only browsers through the VPN by default, but making it easy to add other apps as required.A DNS Protection feature claims to protect your DNS settings from modification by malware. You can also set your DNS to one of several public DNS providers, simply by choosing them from a list: Google, OpenDNS, Verizon, Comodo and DNS Advantage.The app has a handful of settings. You're able to launch it when Windows starts, optionally connect, and choose one of three protocol options: UDP, TCP and HTTPS. As iTop VPN doesn't use any standard VPN protocol, it's not completely clear what the effects of these settings might be, and the descriptions don't help much. (Choosing TCP apparently gets you 'high level privacy', for instance, while opting for UDP means faster speeds but 'more data usage for special occasions.')iTop VPN is also missing some of the more advanced settings we see with other apps. It won't automatically connect when you access insecure Wi-Fi, for example. There are no leak protection options, and we saw no way to control notifications.iTop VPN has some privacy and security extras that we've not seen with other VPNs.A Security Reinforce module scanned our PC for weak or non-standard security settings, then suggested appropriate changes. You'll need some technical knowledge to understand its report, but the advice looks good to us, and is likely to improve your system security.The Browser Privacy feature can check and clear your browsing tracks in Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Opera and even Internet Explorer.These tools aren't the best we've seen, and they're maybe not all suitable for a VPN. Most providers use their own DNS servers rather than OpenVPN or Google, for instance, as that ensures no one else gets to see the sites you visit.But there's also more power here than we expected. DNS Protection isn't something iTop VPN threw together in an afternoon, for instance – it's an IObit feature taken direct from IObit Malware Fighter. Put it all together and the extras could have some value for more experienced users. (Although, as with the main app interface, we'd be happier if the developer sorted out the core features before starting with piling on the extras.)iTop VPN apps have specialist locations for unblocking many platforms, making them far easier to use than many competitors. If you're looking to unblock a supported platform in the US, say, you don't have to start choosing US locations until you find one that works: just choose a service from the list and you're ready to go.We tried this with BBC iPlayer, often a tricky site to unblock, but iTop VPN got us access right away.iTop VPN has Disney Plus locations in New York and Los Angeles. They both worked for us.There are streaming locations for Amazon Prime in the US and UK, but we weren't so lucky with these. Amazon spotted what we were doing, displayed its 'your device is connected to the internet using a VPN or proxy service' and demanded we 'disable it and try again.'It was the same disappointing story with Netflix: iTop VPN has a couple of specialist Netflix servers (US and Korea) but neither worked for us.Getting us into two of our four test sites isn't bad, but other providers do much better. CyberGhost, ExpressVPN, Hide.me, Hola, PrivadoVPN, Private Internet Access, ProtonVPN and Surfshark all unblocked every one of our test platforms in recent reviews.We measured iTop VPN speeds from US and UK locations with a 1Gbps connection in both cases, using several performance testing sites and services (SpeedTest's website and command line app, nPerf, SpeedOfme and more). We checked the download speeds at least five times from each site, and then we repeated all the tests in an evening session.UK download speeds were very ordinary at 180-190Mbps, but US performance was much better, with peak median speeds of around 360-400Mps, even reaching 900Mbps at one point. We're skeptical about that peak score, as it only happened in a single session out of the 20 we ran in the US, and none of the others got near even half that speed. We think the 360-400Mbps figure is more representative of what you're likely to see.That's not a bad result, and it's a close match with the OpenVPN performance we see from the likes of HideMyAss! (270-410Mbps) and TunnelBear (330-350Mbps).iTop's results lag well behind many other VPNs, though, especially when they're using WireGuard and faster protocols (providers such as CyberGhost, IPVanish and NordVPN regularly hit 750-900Mbps).There's another issue, too. That 330-350Mbps we saw from TunnelBear was using a standard OpenVPN connection with a very well-understood level of encryption and security. But iTop VPN uses the company's own custom protocol, which means we can't be sure these figures are a fair comparison. If iTop VPN is using more basic encryption, for instance, that might give it a big performance advantage, but at the cost of some security.iTop VPN has a stack of powerful extras, but it misses on a lot of the VPN fundamentals: there is no OpenVPN or WireGuard, limited unblocking, a flawed kill switch, plus various privacy issues. Its 700MB per day (21GB a month) free plan might be worth considering, but we wouldn't use it for anything privacy-critical.Mike began his career as a lead software developer in the engineering world, where his creations were used by big-name companies from Rolls Royce to British Nuclear Fuels and British Aerospace.

<title>Workable review | TechRadar</title>
<content>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more By Mike Jennings 12 November 2021 While Workable provides plenty of features for recruitment, many rivals go a bit further with their respective offerings.While Workable provides plenty of features for recruitment, many rivals go a bit further with their respective offerings.Workable is a dedicated recruitment platform and Applicant Tracking System and it doesn’t tie into a wider suite of HR products, so it’s got a focused and well-designed range of features.It’s not the cheapest recruitment solution around, though, so it’s going to have to impress if businesses are going to find room for Workable in their budgets.Workable’s features are divided into three strands – the first sources and attracts candidates, the second handles evaluation and interviews, and the third tackles hiring.Workable has one-click job posting to more than 200 job boards, and it integrates with your company’s social media channels so you can advertise your own vacancies. You can also use Workable’s own drag-and-drop system to build your corporate careers page, and job applications from various sources are collated into a single pipeline for easier management.Lots of the processes can be automated, too. Workable’s AI systems supply a list of up to 50 potential candidates when you post a new job – you don’t even have to wait for the resumes to roll in. This service can automatically create social adverts for your positions, and Workable’s Chrome extension can deliver in-depth candidate information based on their social media profiles.Recruiters can also use Workable’s powerful Boolean search options to find suitable candidates. Workable has internal application options and an employee referral platform that can include unique sharing links and referral rewards.Switch over to the evaluation and interview module, and you’ll find more helpful features. You can use more than 700 job description templates that are SEO-optimized, and you can customize your hiring pipeline for consistency and familiarity.The service supports two-way syncing with Gmail and Outlook accounts to help recruiters and candidates stay on the same page, and Workable has an app to allow staff to manage recruitment on the move. Elsewhere, you’ll find collaborative tools that can be used by your whole HR team and in-built support for video interviews, and you can automate candidate communication. Anonymized candidate screening enables more inclusive hiring, and you can assess candidates using skillset, personality, and cognitive ability tests – and then see all the data so you can make informed hiring decisions.Further automation streamlines the hiring process, and you can use a central workflow and timeline to keep staff abreast of hiring processes and budgets. Workable has built-in offer letters and electronic signatures, and Workable also supports national, international, and local regulations to help your company be fully compliant.Workable also integrates with software from Microsoft, Google, Facebook, and LinkedIn, and can also be used with HR tools from Glassdoor, Bamboo, and Indeed. Ultimately, there are dozens of third-party integrations here for products that handle video interviews, assessments, referrals, sourcing, and every other part of the recruitment process.Workable does have a broad range of features, but large companies may want more customization and abilities from an HR product that handles more than just the recruitment process. Workable also misses out on automated reference checking, and it doesn’t have any onboarding options beyond the ability to offer jobs to candidates.Workable’s software is divided into four different products. The Paygo option costs $99 per job posted per month, and it has Workable’s essential features but few of the advanced options – it’s billed as a self-service choice for companies that only hire occasionally.The Core, Growth, and Premier options supply added functionality – the Core option builds on the PayGo service, the Growth tier adds automation options and extra features alongside a dedicated account manager, and the Premier option unlocks every feature alongside bespoke onboarding for the service in your business.Workable doesn’t list the pricing for those three products, though. You’ll have to get in touch with the company and work out costs based on your company’s size and needs.Workable is a straightforward recruitment tool with a good range of features that deliver a well-balanced approach across the entire recruitment process.It’s particularly useful for small and medium-sized businesses who need recruitment software to integrate with other HR services they may use. Still, larger companies with their own HR staff or full-service third-party options may not find this dedicated product necessary.We've also featured the best recruitment platforms, best HR software and best background check servicesSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!Thank you for signing up to TechRadar.

<title>Host Europe web hosting review | TechRadar</title>
<content>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more By Mike Williams , Mirza Bahic 12 November 2021 Host Europe is a strong, stable, and feature-packed web hosting provider geared towards German-speaking customers. If you fall into this category, don’t hesitate to give them a chance.Host Europe is a strong, stable, and feature-packed web hosting provider geared towards German-speaking customers. If you fall into this category, don’t hesitate to give them a chance.Established in 1997 in Germany, Host Europe has become and remained rather successful since, continuing to offer web hosting solutions for individuals, small and medium-sized businesses. They say that their primary objective is to provide their customers with internet and server hosting with the highest quality possible. This rings true if we consider that they’ve collected more than a couple of rewards throughout the years.In the Readers' Choice Host Europe was voted as the best service provider of 2019, the second-best in 2020, and a second-best in the cloud hosting category. They were also awarded gold three times at the Hosting & Service Provider Summits and received other awards by HOSTtest.de and from the test portal CHIP for best-in-class accessibility.Host Europe was one among the brands of HEG (Host Europe Group), a web hosting, email, and domain name registrar giant founded in 1997, same as its subsidiary. In December 2016, HEG was acquired by GoDaddy, and its name is slowly being phased out if the news holds true. However, this shouldn’t impact Host Europe in any significant way.Host Europe is headquartered in Cologne and has two “energy-saving and secure” data centers in Cologne and Strasbourg. If you wish to find out more about these two, the “Technology” section on their website provides plenty of information on the matter.The official site of Host Europe looks and feels old-fashioned, although not necessarily in a bad way since it makes finding your way around rather simple. The site is available in German and English language and it features a good-looking blog, which, unfortunately, isn’t translated into English.You can find Host Europe on Facebook (which is in English although the articles linked there are often in German), and Twitter (which is openly exclusive to its German-speaking followers). Host Europe's solutions include shared hosting, WordPress hosting, ecommerce hosting, VPS, reseller hosting, and dedicated server hosting, as well as domain name registration, SSL certificates, backup storage, site security, Microsoft 365 tools, professional email, and a website builder.Although Host Europe's hosting plans are affordable in general, which of them you get to choose from depends on whether you want to pay on a monthly or an annual basis. The price is identical but if you want to commit for one month only you’ll also have to pay a €14.99 ($17.30) one-off setup fee.Regardless of the billing cycle, for €4.99 ($5.75) per month, the “Basic” plan will supply you with one annual domain, SSL, 50GB of storage space, two MySQL databases, one automated mailbox migration (included in the first 30 days), and Kaspersky virus protection. More expensive plans won’t add further features but increase the amount of storage space, the number of databases, and the number of antivirus software solutions.While Host Europe doesn’t offer a money-back guarantee, you can cancel your contract with them within four weeks.As for payment methods, Host Europe accepts all major credit cards, PayPal, and SEPA direct debit. To create an account with Host Europe you’ll have to provide your full name, phone number, email, and physical address, and think up a strong password. Here, you can choose whether you want to be contacted via email, phone, or both. Depending on your choice, you’ll receive an order confirmation via message or email together, containing extremely detailed explanations of the features you can expect to receive, the cancellation policy, and the General Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy.After adding your payment details and making a purchase, you’ll be transferred to Host Europe’s dashboard, which (unfortunately for non-German users) suffers from an incomplete translation to English. To be fair, most important information is fully translated to English, but there are still parts in German, including the FAQ section accessible through the dashboard.Since Host Europe is not the swiftest of providers, you may have to hang around for a while before finding out whether your order was accepted or not. If yes, you’ll still have to provide additional information about your order before you can start using the product you've purchased. As of late, Host Europe provides user-friendly cPanel with its Linux-based products, and Plesk is available with the Windows hosting packages - the two most popular control panels in the industry. As for website building, in addition to a whole variety of CMS options (WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, and so on), ecommerce apps (Magento, Blestan, OpenCart, and more), community building tools (phpBB, Booked, Dada Mail, and so forth) and other useful apps you can easily install via Installatron, you’ll also get a bare-bones version of a beginner-friendly website builder. To get more of everything (sites, webspace per site, templates, email accounts, and so forth) you’ll have to purchase one of the bigger website builder plans as an add-on. After putting Host Europe’s official site to the GTmetrix speed test, we got average results altogether. The time it took for the site to fully load was an amazing 1.3 seconds but all other vital speed measuring metrics (largest contentful paint, total blocking time, and cumulative layout shift) got trapped in the abyss of averageness pulling the final score down to B (74%).When it comes to uptime, Host Europe guarantees an availability of its data centers at 99.95% as a monthly mean, with the exclusion of scheduled (and unscheduled) maintenance windows. This can be translated into 4.5 hours of downtime annually, or about 10 minutes for two weeks.After monitoring the uptime of Host Europe's official site via UptimeRobot for two weeks, we recorded a worrying 55 minutes of downtime which dragged the total uptime to 99.76%, meaning that we should be getting some sweet credit as compensation.If you find yourself in need of a helping hand, you can try reaching Host Europe's team via email, fax, live chat, and, if you’re in a rush, around-the-clock telephone number. The toll-free numbers are available for users from Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, as well as the “order hotline” which is reachable Monday to Friday, from 9 AM to 5 PM. There is even Host Europe's postal address if you feel like writing them an old-fashioned letter and recalling the “old days”. Alternatively, you can browse their “Forms and documents” section for questions related to terms of service, and it is available both in English and German. There is also a well-equipped FAQ section (it’s closer to a knowledge base), but it still isn’t translated into English, which means all users who don’t understand German are left to fend for themselves. Unfortunately, there is no community forum as a final resort before reaching the support personnel. If you want a well-rounded host that will give you more than enough time to decide whether you want to stay with them or part your ways, HostGator may be worth a look. Besides offering an ample 45-day money-back guarantee, it is also geared towards English-speaking users making itself more attractive to an international market than Host Europe.Another US-based alternative to Host Europe is Bluehost, a host that is known for its pocket-friendly pricing and not particularly pocket-friendly price spike after the promotional period. Although with Host Europe there is a one-off setup fee with all monthly plans, at least you won’t have to worry about any sudden price spikes.If you are looking for a simple solution from Germany aimed at personal sites or small businesses, a Berlin-based Strato might be worth a try. Although their scope of hosting solution seems somewhat limited, all their plans support multiple-domain hosting, come with a free domain, a free SSL certificate, plenty of one-click installs, a website builder, and a 30-day “no quibble” money-back guarantee. Unlike Host Europe, Strato doesn’t offer a monthly billing option, although the one you get with Host Europe will set you back with a one-off setup fee.Hostinger is one of the most popular hosts from Europe. It offers its users an access to its servers which are found all around the world including the Americas, Europe, and Asia. Thanks to its 14-day “observation” period you can try out everything for yourselves without a need to worry about your budget. Unfortunately, you will not get such a chance with Host Europe.Host Europe is an award-winning veteran from Germany trusted by over 250.000 customers as we write, and the number keeps on growing. If you can come to terms with data centers in Germany and France (kind of), self-help options being in German only, somewhat sluggish sign-up procedure, and considerable one-off setup fees (with monthly plans), be sure to give Host Europe a chance. If not, HostGator or Bluehost might be a better choice. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!Thank you for signing up to TechRadar.

<title>Atlas VPN review | TechRadar</title>
<content>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more By Mike Williams 12 November 2021 Atlas VPN misses in some areas with its underpowered apps and feeble support site, but there's also plenty to like – it's P2P friendly, with great WireGuard-powered download speeds and no device limits for a very, very low price. Factor in the experience it'll gain after being acquired by NordVPN, and we think Atlas only gets better from.Atlas VPN misses in some areas with its underpowered apps and feeble support site, but there's also plenty to like – it's P2P friendly, with great WireGuard-powered download speeds and no device limits for a very, very low price. Factor in the experience it'll gain after being acquired by NordVPN, and we think Atlas only gets better from.Atlas VPN is a capable VPN provider which offers a decent all-round service for some of the lowest prices around.There's support for the speedy WireGuard protocol, for instance. You get apps for Windows, Mac, iOS and Android, a kill switch to protect you if the VPN drops, and the service allows unlimited simultaneous connections.A SafeSwap feature changes your IP address regularly while you're connected to the same server, maximizing your anonymity.Bonus features include ad and malware blocking, while data breach monitoring alerts you if any of your personal details are found on the dark web.Atlas VPN's network is smaller than many, with 700 servers spread across 27 countries. It'll be enough for many users, though, and P2P is supported everywhere.The really interesting news here came in October 2021, when Nord Security (the company behind NordVPN) announced it had acquired Atlas VPN. That tells you, all on its own, that Atlas isn't just another identikit VPN provider: there's some substance here, something worth buying. And although Atlas VPN will continue as an independent provider, it'll surely benefit in future from Nord Security's resources and experience.Atlas VPN's free no-registration-required plan gives you an easy way to try out the service, though with a couple of significant limits: 400MB per day for data, and three locations only (Amsterdam, New York, Los Angeles).That's not bad, and outperforms the free competition in some areas. Avira's Phantom VPN limits you to 500MB a month, for instance. Avast One's VPN has a generous 5GB a week data allowance, but doesn't support changing locations. ProtonVPN's free offering still wins out for its unlimited data and 12 locations.Opting for a paid plan drops the data and location limits. Prices start at an average $9.99 for monthly billing, and you can pay by card, PayPal and Google Pay. Upgrade to an annual account and the price plummets to just $2.49 a month, while the three-year plan is an amazing $1.39 a month (okay, only for the first term, and it's $3.99 on renewal, but that still looks like a good deal to us).Too good to be true? We'll check that later, but if you sign up and are unhappy, you're protected by a 30-day money-back guarantee.Beware, though: plans automatically renew when you sign up, and there's no way to change this or cancel your account from the control panel. You must email support and ask for help.Atlas VPN has the privacy basics covered with its WireGuard support, AES-256 encryption, kill switch and private DNS system.Unusual extras like rotating IP addresses along with ad and tracker-blocking should bring extra privacy protection.Atlas VPN's own policies aren't as impressive. Access its website for the first time and its cookie disclaimer only has an 'Accept' option, for instance. If you give the company your email address, you're opted in to receive marketing emails unless you specifically say otherwise. And the Blacklight Privacy Inspector found the site used Google Analytics, Facebook and assorted other tracking technologies.(Don't take our or Blacklight's word for it – even Atlas VPN's anti-tracker technology decided it was best to block three trackers on its own website.)Atlas VPN has been through what it calls an independent security audit, but this is just about as limited as we've seen.The exercise only covered the iOS app, for instance. It was a black box review, which means the auditors tested the functionality of the app, but didn't see the source code. And although Atlas VPN quoted some of the results in a blog post, it hasn't published the full report, so there's no way to judge it for ourselves.Okay, this is better than nothing, but only just, and it can't match the best of the competition. TunnelBear has annual audits of its apps, servers and backend infrastructure, for instance, and publishes the results for everyone to see.Atlas VPN claims to have a 'solid no-logs policy', saying 'we do not collect details on our users' activities, DNS queries, or other data that could be linked to our users.'The privacy policy says Atlas VPN's apps collect some device data, though. This includes: 'device type, model, brand name (e.g. Samsung, Apple), OS version, device ID, language, time zone, coarse location (city scale).'It also mentions using 'attribution analytics to track install source and traffic source', and 'advertising IDs to measure performance of our campaigns.'Put it all together and there's nothing to indicate Atlas VPN logs any of your online activities. It does have enough data to build user profiles, though, including details on user devices, when they connect and the amount of data they use. And as Atlas VPN hasn't had its no logging claims audited, there's no independent evidence to tell us if it's living up to its promises.The Windows app is basic, and covers only the VPN fundamentals: a location list of cities, a Connect/Disconnect button, and a handful of settings. (The latter consists of a 'Start on launch' option, an On/Off toggle for the kill switch, and a choice of WireGuard or IKEv2 protocols.)The developer hasn't paid much attention to usability. The location list covers cities, for instance, but they're not grouped by country or sorted in any order we could recognize. ('Germany, Serbia, USA - New Jersey, Hong Kong, Poland, Japan' is a part of the sequence – can you see any pattern?)There's no Favorites system or Recently Used list, either, so changing location is always going to require some scrolling.Our connection attempts failed sometimes with the free Atlas servers, perhaps a sign that they're overloaded. But this wasn't an issue once we upgraded, and connection times were decent at an average 5-6 seconds.Atlas claims its app has malware and ad blocking. There's no sign of this in the app itself, though, and it made no visible difference to us. We saw far better results by installing the free uBlock Origin.Our kill switch tests began with us simulating a dropped VPN. The good news is the kill switch immediately blocked our internet, ensuring we couldn't use the unprotected connection. The bad news – well, where to begin?The app didn't raise an alert when the VPN failed, for instance. It didn't try to reconnect, either. In a real-world situation you might easily waste time checking networks, rebooting your device, or even the router, before you figured out why your internet was down.Usually we could restore normal operations by hitting the Connect button. Sometimes this failed, though, with the app recommending we turned off the kill switch. What, it even blocked its own internet access? Really?We reluctantly agreed to turn the kill switch off, and the app then connected. But when we checked Settings, the kill switch was still marked as on – it hadn't been disabled, after all.Confused? Us too. Overall, the kill switch protected us from dropped connections, and that's what matters most. But the app could do a lot more to keep users informed, and get the VPN up and running again at the maximum possible speed.Desktop VPN apps normally beat their mobile VPN cousins for features, but not here. Atlas VPN's Android app outperforms its Windows offering in several areas.The location list works as expected, for instance, with countries grouped by continent and sorted alphabetically.There's a separate list of Streaming Servers, apparently optimized to reduce buffering, something not included on the desktop build.Settings are essentially the same as Windows, including a kill switch and support for WireGuard and IKEv2 protocols.An Assistant page hosts a tracker blocking feature and the Data Breach Monitor, more options that we couldn't find on Windows. We ran a quick check of these, and found they offered some value. Turning on tracker blocking protected us from some trackers, and entering an email into the Data Breach Monitor listed some of the breaches where our credentials were exposed.Atlas VPN's iOS app also improves on the Windows client with its sensibly sorted location list, tracker blocking and Data Breach Monitor options. It's a little short on features, though, with no WireGuard support or kill switch.Atlas VPN's support website is a little limited, and that's putting it politely. There are very few articles, most don't cover the topics you need, and many of what's left only have a few lines of content.The Troubleshooting section is a great example. We hoped to see some sound general advice on installation problems, issues with app features or download speeds. Instead, we found only four articles on very specific issues, such as 'How to fix error 13801 on Windows?' and 'What if my PC does not support Atlas VPN 64-bit?'(And if you're expecting any depth with the help provided, prepare for disappointment. This is the entire and unedited answer to that last question: 'No need to worry if your Windows device does not support Atlas VPN 64-bit: you can download the 32-bit version here.')Atlas VPN has no live chat support, but you can contact the company via email. We sent a message with a couple of simple product questions. Does the Windows app have tracker blocking? And which, if any of the apps block malicious websites or ads, as none of them mention it anywhere?A reply arrived just over two hours later, not bad for a response time.The message read: 'The mentioned features are currently being tested, therefore they are not available on all platforms. They should be rolled out to other OS'es soon, however, we are unable to provide an exact ETA as it may be misleading.'As Atlas VPN couldn't tell us which apps support malicious website or ad blocking, we'll assume the feature isn't available yet. That might have changed by the time you read this, but if it's a priority for you, ask the company before you sign up.Atlas VPN hadn't always impressed us so far, but it got off to a great unblocking start by getting us into BBC iPlayer.Accessing US Amazon was more difficult than usual, as it asked us to complete a CAPTCHA first. IP reputation service IPQualityScore revealed that our Atlas server IP address had a fraud rating of 100, with recent abuse reported. That's not anything directly to do with Atlas VPN, but it suggests the free plan and low prices might make the company especially appealing to hackers. That makes for more blacklisted IPs, and could mean more CAPTCHAS and other security hassles for you.Once we'd accessed US Amazon Prime, though, Atlas allowed us to stream content right away. We moved on to Disney Plus and were able to access that site, too.US Netflix is the jewel in the unblocking crown, though, and it was out of Atlas VPN's reach. We weren't able to view content from any of Atlas VPN's US servers.We measure VPN performance by running several benchmarking services – SpeedTest's website and command line app, SpeedOf.me, nPerf – from both a UK data center and a US residential location. We run each benchmark five times using WireGuard and OpenVPN (where available), run them a second time several hours later (that's a minimum of 120 tests), then analyze the data to see what's going on.Atlas VPN doesn't support OpenVPN, but its IKEv2 speeds were reasonable at a mid-range 260-320Mpps in the US, 170-210Mbps in the UK.Switching to WireGuard made a big difference, though, with speeds jumping to 590-600Mbps in the UK, and 650-800Mbps in the US. That's not quite a performance leader – NordVPN peaked at 880Mbps, IPVanish at 900Mbps – but it beat names like Windscribe (430-480Mbps), StrongVPN (450Mbps) and Surfshark (450-475Mbps).Atlas VPN may not have the best network, or apps, or support site – for those, you'd have to go for a more established provider like ExpressVPN. But now it's owned by Nord Security, we'd expect to see some improvements. And even right now, Atlas VPN's speeds are good, it unblocks more sites than many, and the three-year plan is as cheap as you'll see anywhere.Mike began his career as a lead software developer in the engineering world, where his creations were used by big-name companies from Rolls Royce to British Nuclear Fuels and British Aerospace.

<title>Calendar.com review | TechRadar</title>
<content>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more By Stefan Ionescu 11 November 2021 Calendar.com is a long-standing name on the market for calendar apps, and its developers have put a lot of effort into making it a good, well-rounded solution. The interface is very light on the eyes and works smoothly, and the app itself offers lots of different features aimed at users with specific needs. It comes in several pricing tiers – including a free one – that allow users to pick the version that best matches their individual preferences. Calendar.com is a long-standing name on the market for calendar apps, and its developers have put a lot of effort into making it a good, well-rounded solution. The interface is very light on the eyes and works smoothly, and the app itself offers lots of different features aimed at users with specific needs. It comes in several pricing tiers – including a free one – that allow users to pick the version that best matches their individual preferences. If you’ve spent some time looking for a good calendar app, you’ve probably noticed that the market tends to be divided into two main categories. On one hand, we have apps aimed at individual users, offering a small but solid set of features that fit most needs. On the other hand, there are also the more advanced, professional calendar apps that offer lots of features and are designed to work best in large organizations.Calendar.com is a little bit of both, with features that can make it an attractive choice for regular home users, while also offering a competent professional package suitable for organizations of different sizes. The app is offered on multiple platforms as well, making it one of the most versatile offers on the market at the moment. Users can easily check out the free version and then upgrade to one of the premium tiers, and it doesn’t take long to set it up on different devices.There are three plans available – Free, Standard ($6/month), and Pro ($8/month). The free plan comes with pretty much everything one might need for regular daily use, and doesn’t lock any critical features behind a paywall, unlike some competing apps. Users on this tier can connect to one calendar on an external platform, and will have one basic workspace to use. It’s worth noting that up to five members can be added to a single workspace, even on a free tier, which makes the app better for collaboration for those who don’t want to pay for a premium solution.The two premium tiers add a variety of extra features aimed primarily at users in organizations. This includes the ability to sync more calendars under a single account, unlimited workspace members, meetings with 25 and even 50 guests, and analytics that can help you gain a deeper understanding of your scheduling habits. Calendar.com comes with all standard features you would expect to find in a modern calendar app. You can view your schedule in different modes – day/week/month/year, and can easily share your calendar with other users, including those on Google services. Free users can set up meetings with up to 5 attendants, and the app offers advanced scheduling options to help you find the best available timeslot.Some of the features offered by Calendar.com can’t be found in other similar apps, or at least not often – such as the ability to embed calendars in web pages, and the native Zapier integration. Zoom integration is available as well, though only on the premium tiers. For most individual users, this shouldn’t matter much, but for those planning to use Calendar.com in an organization, subscribing to one of the premium tiers will be a good idea. The interface of Calendar.com doesn’t shine with anything unusual, but it gets the job done more or less fine. The app leans towards a more minimalistic design, hiding elements that are not used frequently and focusing on the major parts of the interface. That said, you should find it very easy to dig up any feature you might need, and it doesn’t take long to get used to the way the interface is organized.The app does tend to flow a bit better with a premium subscription, mainly because it unlocks its full range of features. The free tier still has its benefits though – especially for those looking for simplicity and a clean design. Some users might find the additional features in the premium tiers confusing, since many of them are aimed at organizations and similar use cases. Give the free version a try before deciding to upgrade to a premium plan, as it might work just fine for your specific needs.The company provides standard email support on top of their help knowledge base, and they additionally offer some special options to premium subscribers. If you’re on the Standard or Pro tier, you can get in touch with support representatives over the phone, and your inquiries will be prioritized. Free users will still get support, but in a more limited capacity. Most of the problems you may encounter during your use of the app should already be covered in the knowledgebase in any case.Calendar.com manages to stand out with its set of features and pricing plans. The app faces direct competition from Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, and other popular solutions like Fantastical. It still has a dedicated user base, and some have been with it for many years at this point. Choosing between Calendar.com and some of its popular competitors is mostly about personal choice with regards to things like interface organization and pricing, and the app is definitely worth checking out if you’re currently comparing the different options on the market.The app does a great job on all fronts, and can be equally useful to individuals as well as large organizations. It takes some time to get used to how it works, but after that, everything is quite easy. The strong support it receives from its developers is nothing but a huge plus as well, so if you’re looking for a good calendar app that covers all important bases at a reasonable price, look no further.We've also featured the best calendar apps and best time management appsStefan has always been a lover of tech.

<title>FastVPN review | TechRadar</title>
<content>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more By Mike Williams 12 November 2021 Seriously cheap for the first year, but you can see why: the desktop apps are unreliable, and there are very features. For unblocking Netflix and basic tasks only.Seriously cheap for the first year, but you can see why: the desktop apps are unreliable, and there are very features. For unblocking Netflix and basic tasks only.FastVPN is a simple VPN owned by Namecheap, the popular domain registrar and web hosting service.If you're wondering why you should trust a domain registrar to run your VPN, good question. No need to worry, though; it's using servers run by an arm of StackPath, which has also provided the network for major VPN brands such as IPVanish and StrongVPN.Whoever owns the network, it's a decent size, with 1,000+ P2P-friendly servers spread across 75+ locations worldwide. Apps are available for Windows, Mac, iOS and Android; tutorials show how to set up the service on Linux and various routers, and, unusually, there are no annoying limits on the number of devices you can connect at one time.The feature list is basic, though, covering the bare essentials only. You get OpenVPN and IKEv2 protocol support (no WireGuard), secure DNS to reduce the chance of DNS leaks, a kill switch to block internet access if the VPN drops, and that's about it.FastVPN's starting prices are some of the lowest around, thanks to big discounts off your first term.Sign up for the monthly plan, for instance, and you'll pay nothing at all for the first month, effectively a 30-day free trial, rising to a still-excellent $5.88 on renewal.The annual plan is just $1 a month for year one, rising to $2.88 on renewal. There are no longer-term plans (the old three-year option has disappeared.)These are very low first-term prices (and they're pretty good on renewal, too). Private Internet Access is one of our go-to VPNs for value, but with monthly plans at $9.95, dropping to $3.33 paid annually, it's still no match for FastVPN.If you are tempted, you're able to by card or PayPal, and there's a 30-day money-back guarantee to protect you if it all goes wrong.The FastVPN website comments briefly on logging, saying you'll "keep your browsing activities to yourself with our strict no-log policy" and that the service "won’t track, collect, or share any of your logs". We searched the website for something more detailed, without any luck. The only extra information we found came from the Windows VPN app installer, which warned that it collected "aggregated anonymous app usage data, including your device and OS version so we can troubleshoot and improve our app", but "that's it", and that there's "no tracking of your personal identifiable information".We'd like a little more substance than that, and ideally a security or no-logging audit, but that doesn't seem likely to happen any time soon. FastVPN is targeted at the average consumer who wants something easy to use which 'just works', and not the kind of user who cares about session logging or whether it uses AES-256-CBC or GCM.FastVPN's Windows app opens with a default 'Best Available' server choice, and a 'Connect VPN' button. The client displays the name of your current network, too, a handy way to be sure you're connecting to the official coffee shop Wi-Fi, and not some shady open network nearby.A location picker to the left gives a list of countries (some with city-level choices), server load and ping time information (you can sort by those, too), simple Favorites system to easily group your most commonly used locations.Although this looked good in theory, real-world performance was poor. OpenVPN connections took up to 40 seconds, three to four times faster than we usually see, and IKEv2 connections were also poor at 18-20 seconds.That was just the start. Occasionally, after connecting, we found we couldn't access any websites. Sometimes the VPN dropped, complaining of various internal errors or that there was 'no network detected.' It didn't help that some of these error messages were layered on top of normal status information, making them difficult to read. Not a huge issue, but it all helps to create a poor impression of the app. We expect better from a big company such as Namecheap.Settings are relatively limited: auto-start options, a choice of protocol (IKEv2, OpenVPN TCP/ UDP, and a Scramble option to help bypass VPN blocking), and a kill switch to block internet access if the VPN drops.The app handled unexpected disconnects very well. We forcibly closed our IKEv2 connection, the app noticed, displayed a notification and reconnected at once. So, we closed the connection again, then kept closing it, as fast we could, interrupting every reconnect attempt. That's a level of stress testing which goes way beyond what you're likely to see in real life, but the app just waited until we'd finished, then reconnected as before.The kill switch generally worked well, too. Whatever we did to IKEv2 or OpenVPN connections, the app raised an alert, wasn't especially troubled by our extreme testing methods and reconnected as soon as it could, without ever leaving us unprotected. FastVPN's Android VPN app looks and feels very similar to the Windows edition: big green Connect button, by default you're connected to the nearest server, but you can choose something else from a searchable list of locations.We noticed small usability issues. The desktop app hides city locations by default, and they're only visible if you expand a specific country. The mobile app displays city and country names in the same list, so there's much more scrolling (and the cities aren't always displayed in alphabetical order, either.) Settings are basic, too, with protocol options reduced to OpenVPN UDP or TCP (no IKEv2, this time).FastVPN's iOS app is very similar, but does add one very useful feature. An Always On option enables automatically connecting to the VPN whenever you access untrusted networks, while also ignoring networks you know are safe (home, work, etc).These apps aren't bad, and they didn't have the technical issues we saw on the desktop. But they're also short on features, and can't begin to compete with the best VPNs.FastVPN doesn't make any specific claims about its website-unblocking abilities, but generally suggests it can help you 'securely unblock sites and content.'This certainly worked as a BBC iPlayer VPN, where FastVPN got us access with the first location we tried.The service scored an even big victory when it unblocked US Netflix, a task which defeats many big VPN names.But FastVPN couldn't keep up that level of success, and it failed with Amazon Prime Video and Disney+.That's not a bad result, but we've seen some providers do much better. CyberGhost, ExpressVPN, Hide.me, Private Internet Access, ProtonVPN and Surfshark all unblocked everything in their latest reviews.We measured FastVPN speeds from a UK data center with excellent connectivity and a 1Gbps connection, giving us room to see exactly what the service could do.FastVPN turned out to be not so fast after all, with both OpenVPN and IKEv2 speeds reaching a modest 250Mbps. That's better than some - NordVPN and IPVanish didn't reach 200Mbps with OpenVPN - but a long way behind OpenVPN leaders such as HideMyAss! (340-350Mbps), Hide.me (390Mbps) and ProtonVPN (400-460Mbps.)There's another problem. OpenVPN is the fastest protocol FastVPN supports, but most providers give you much more capable options. IPVanish's WireGuard connections hit 750-900Mbps in recent reviews, for instance, while NordVPN's NordLynx was a close match at 760-880Mbps.So despite the name, there's no chance this service will appear in our list of the truly fastest VPNs. But although FastVPN trails far behind in the speed stakes, it's also far from the worst we've seen, and the service should handle most browsing or streaming tasks with ease.FastVPN's ultra-low starter prices caught our eye, but the Windows app was unreliable and there are very few features. Could work as a cheap VPN for unblocking Netflix and other basic tasks, but this isn't the service for experienced or demanding users. Assuming you want something better, we'd suggest going for our #1 rated ExpressVPN or, to save on costs, the also brilliant Surfshark.Mike began his career as a lead software developer in the engineering world, where his creations were used by big-name companies from Rolls Royce to British Nuclear Fuels and British Aerospace.

<title>Zoho Recruit review | TechRadar</title>
<content>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more By Mike Jennings 12 November 2021 Zoho Recruit offers excellent features that are easy to use though this recruitment tool can be expensive for smaller businesses.Zoho Recruit offers excellent features that are easy to use though this recruitment tool can be expensive for smaller businesses.Zoho Recruit is one of the biggest Applicant Tracking System (ATS) services in the world, so it’s going to be right at the top of most people’s lists if they need some help with their hunt for top-quality staff.There’s plenty going for Zoho Recruit, including a free option and a broad range of features. Still, we’ve also got questions about some of the firm’s support options and integration abilities.Zoho Recruit has a broad range of features that are divided into three kinds of product – one for companies, another for recruitment agencies and a third for people who need to hire temporary staff.The Corporate HR product allows you to post job openings to hundreds of different mainstream and niche job boards, and you can boost job listings on social networks. You can also search through resumes with AI-powered modules that will find candidates on your behalf. You can set up a dedicated resume inbox and invite recruiters to submit potential candidates through a portal with your own branding. You can also establish an employee referral portal to allow your existing staff to give recommendations.Zoho’s AI features are robust and impressive. Applicants can be graded in advance based on your preferred traits and requirements, and advanced searches help narrow down the candidate pool.You can use Zoho’s background screening module to run background checks so you can adhere to your preferred hiring practices, and you can ask candidates to complete pre-screening assessments to help eliminate unsuitable people and streamline the process.HR staff and candidates can access dedicated portals to track the status of applications, and Zoho allows you to track recruitment stats and analyze data. Thanks to a customized series of alerts, rules, and actions, corporate HR staff can also automate much of the recruitment process. Impressively, Zoho’s entire experience can be customized, from the branding and aesthetic of the software to custom tabs and layout options.Switch over to Zoho’s agency module, and you get the same features alongside options to have powerful client portals that allow agency clients to create vacancies easily, send feedback and invite people to interview. And if you use Zoho’s temporary staff product, you’ll receive help from straightforward and powerful scheduling and timesheet tools alongside electronic signatures and invoicing to speed up laborious parts of the process. Temporary workers can also access their own portal to mark their availability and view their workloads.Zoho does have good features, but some things are missing here too. Zoho Recruit has integrations with Outlook, LinkedIn, Google Suite, and a selection of other products and services, but you’ll find more integration ability elsewhere.This service doesn’t have as many behavioral, skill, and cognitive testing options as some other recruitment services, either. You only get 24/7 support if you pay extra, too – standard plans only have support five days of the week.Zoho’s broader company offers a full range of HR products, which is excellent if you want to pick and choose features or opt for a more comprehensive HR solution. Sadly, though, that means you don’t get onboarding unless you pay more.Zoho’s standard Corporate HR package costs $25 per month if you buy annually, and you get the service’s core features alongside candidate sourcing, resume management, tracking, and Google, Zoho, and Microsoft Outlook integrations. If you buy the $50 per month Enterprise product, you get AI-powered candidate matching, improvement portal management, and advanced customization. On top of that, you’ll need to pay extra for hiring manager and vendor portal licenses.Recruitment agencies can pay for $25, $50, and $75 tiers, with the two latter options adding extra features. That $50 choice adds AI matching, advanced analytics, better security control, portal management, and candidate assessment options. The top-tier service adds more customization and portal options.The temporary employee package has a simple, single price of $59 a month, although you’ll have to pay more if you want to hire more than 25 employees.Zoho Recruit’s three products also have free tiers that give you candidate management, interview scheduling, and simple resume search options alongside other basic features. Still, these options are restrictive – HR departments can only list one vacancy at a time, and the temporary staff package is limited to five people.Zoho Recruit has an impressive selection of features, no matter which package you choose. It doesn’t require a huge amount of technical knowledge to use and excels when it comes to customization and AI-powered extras. It offers a broad slate of recruitment options for HR departments, temporary staff needs, and agencies, and it can be easily incorporated into a wider HR product if necessary.The costs can mount up, especially if you want a full HR or recruitment solution, and you may want to look elsewhere if you need more testing options, extension integration, or better support.For most companies and agencies, though, Zoho Recruit will prove excellent, and is one of the recruitment services you need to consider.We've also featured the best recruitment platforms, best HR software and best background check servicesSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!Thank you for signing up to TechRadar.

<title>iTop VPN | TechRadar</title>
<content>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more By Mike Williams 12 November 2021 iTop VPN's generous 700MB/day (21GB/month) free plan might be worth a look for simple, non-privacy-critical tasks, but the service has too many fundamental issues to justify handing over your cash.iTop VPN's generous 700MB/day (21GB/month) free plan might be worth a look for simple, non-privacy-critical tasks, but the service has too many fundamental issues to justify handing over your cash.iTop VPN is a free VPN service with an affordable paid plan and one or two unusual privacy extras.The free plan gives you 700MB of data per day (21GB per month), and a choice of 16 locations (including the US and UK), easily beating most of the competition.Paying for a subscription gets you access to 100+ locations and 1,800+ streaming and gaming-optimized servers. (P2P is supported, too, though only on a handful of specialist servers.)A longer-than-usual list of bonus features include split tunneling, along with ad, tracker and malware blocking, browser history cleaning, and a Security Reinforce tool checks your device privacy settings and warns of any problems.iTop VPN has apps for Windows, Mac (a recent addition), Android and iOS, and support for connecting up to five devices simultaneously.This VPN's monthly plan is priced at $11.99, not the highest we've seen, but more expensive than most.Paying six months upfront cuts the cost to $6.99 a month, but that's still above average. You're paying iTop $41.94 to get your six months of cover, for instance, but Private Internet Access only asks $39.95 for a full year ($3.33 a month).iTop isn't done yet, though. Opt for its annual plan and you'll get an extra year thrown in, giving you two year's protection for $2.31 a month. A handful of providers are even cheaper – Private Internet Access has a three-year plan for $2.19 a month, Ivacy and PrivadoVPN go even lower – but that still looks like a real bargain.iTop supports payments via card, PayPal and bank transfers. It's good to see that you can turn off auto-renewal when you purchase the service, too, ensuring you won't accidentally pay for a second term that you don't want.Even better, if you're unhappy, a 15-day 'no questions asked' money-back guarantee (7 days for monthly-billed plans) means you're able to get your first payment back, too.Most VPNs protect your privacy by using secure VPN protocols such as WireGuard and OpenVPN. This doesn't guarantee you'll be safe – a provider can easily make mistakes in how they're set up – but they're open source, so anyone can see how they work or check the code for problems.However, iTop uses a custom scheme of its own. The Windows app appears to make a fast proxy connection to the VPN server, then uses an open source package called WinDivert to direct your traffic through the tunnel, apparently encrypting it with iTop's own protocol.Maybe this is secure, maybe it's not, but the company doesn't provide enough information to judge. You can't check the encryption it uses, for instance.We noticed a separate privacy issue on the iTop VPN website. Its SSL certificate wasn't properly configured, and this allowed us to access areas of the site, including the Login page, using an unencrypted HTTP connection. Unless you're using the VPN, that risks exposing your credentials to snoopers.iTop scores another privacy thumbs-down for its order form, where it insisted we entered our full name, city and post or ZIP code. A tooltip tried to justify this by saying that the details 'allow us to contact you if there are any issues with your order.' Uh, isn't that what our email address is for?iTop VPN claims to have a no logging policy, and the privacy policy spells out what this means.The company does its best to sound reassuring, telling users: 'We do not log your activity while you are utilizing the Services, including your browsing history, the bandwidth you used, or how long you connected to VPN servers. We do not store your original IP address or the server IP address that you connect to.'Sounds good, but we already know this can't be entirely true. iTop VPN limits its free plan to 700MB a day, so to make this work it must log the bandwidth you use and associate it with a device ID.Scroll down the page and you'll find a 'What information we collect' section, which could also include a lot of data: '...operating system, device ID, Internet protocol addresses, browser type, browser language, referring/exit pages, clickstream data of our websites and our products or services, and the pages or features of our software or services accessed by you and the time spent there.'Some of that looks like it's referring to the website, not iTop's apps, but the fact that we're left to guess is a problem. A privacy policy should be clear and precise, not leave us with more questions than it answers.Whatever you think of iTop VPN's claims, the real problem here is the company hasn't had them confirmed by any kind of security or logging audit. We're left to take iTop on trust, and hope the firm is delivering what it promises.iTop VPN's apps look good and are stuffed with features, but also score poorly on many of the usability fundamentals.Hitting a big red Connect button should by default automatically connect you to the nearest server, for instance. But even though we were testing from the UK, the free app regularly connected us to Japan, and the paid plan sometimes chose Germany.An 'All Servers' list enables switching to another location, but this also isn't as easy as it should be. For example, the countries aren't sorted by name, continent, distance or any other order we could recognize (there are sequences like Korea, Russia, UK, Italy, Singapore and so on). And there's no Favorites system or Recently Used lists to help out.The app is missing some usability shortcuts we commonly see elsewhere. You can't double click a location name to connect, for instance – you must click a location's Connect button, instead. When the app does connect (or disconnect), there's no notification to alert you, so you won't know whether you're protected unless you keep an eye on the app interface.On the plus side, you get separate Streaming, Social and Gaming lists where you can view locations optimized for specific platforms (PUBG, Warzone, Netflix, Disney Plus, Amazon Prime, iPlayer, Hulu and more).Too much scrolling? The Quick Access pane lists 17 common reasons for using a VPN: Browse Privacy, Hide Location, Watch Netflix, Play PUBG, Unblock WhatsApp (or Telegram, Facebook, Twitter etc), and more. If you're looking to unblock Netflix, there's no need to scan down a lengthy list of servers and try to guess which is best: just tap 'Watch Netflix' and the app automatically chooses a location for you.These work well, and we like the flexibility. But we'd prefer iTop VPN to sort out some of the interface basics before it layers on any more extras.iTop VPN's Mac app mostly looks like the Windows build, but with a few very noticeable changes.There's no Downloading section, for instance – the P2P locations are in the 'All Servers' lists. The Quick Tasks section doesn't have a Play PUBG tile. There's no kill switch and no Settings menu (the Protocols list is now on the main screen). If you regularly use both the Windows and Mac apps, the differences could be a little confusing.The iOS app is all about simplicity, with no Settings menu, no kill switch, no P2P, no HTTPS protocol option, and absolutely no bonus privacy tools. Instead, you just get the location lists, a big Connect button and a choice of TCP/UDP protocols.There's good news in one iOS area. Cities are grouped into countries, making for a shorter and better-organized list. But it's still not sorted alphabetically (and to make it worse, the iOS app uses a different order to the Windows build).The Android app is essentially the iOS version with added split tunneling, and yet another sort order for the servers list. Not a big deal unless you're using iTop VPN on several platforms – only then will you need to remember where your favorite locations appear on each device.iTop VPN supports a kill switch to stop internet traffic if the VPN drops unexpectedly. We found the Windows app was mostly successful, but had some flaws. When we forcibly crashed the app, for instance, our VPN connection dropped, the kill switch didn't kick in, and our traffic was unprotected. And as the app doesn't raise any notifications, an affected user is unlikely to realize they're at risk in such a scenario.Split tunneling support allows you to decide which apps use the tunnel, and which don't. It's handy if you only need the VPN to unblock a couple of websites, say, as other apps can use your normal (and faster) connection. This worked well for us, directing only browsers through the VPN by default, but making it easy to add other apps as required.A DNS Protection feature claims to protect your DNS settings from modification by malware. You can also set your DNS to one of several public DNS providers, simply by choosing them from a list: Google, OpenDNS, Verizon, Comodo and DNS Advantage.The app has a handful of settings. You're able to launch it when Windows starts, optionally connect, and choose one of three protocol options: UDP, TCP and HTTPS. As iTop VPN doesn't use any standard VPN protocol, it's not completely clear what the effects of these settings might be, and the descriptions don't help much. (Choosing TCP apparently gets you 'high level privacy', for instance, while opting for UDP means faster speeds but 'more data usage for special occasions.')iTop VPN is also missing some of the more advanced settings we see with other apps. It won't automatically connect when you access insecure Wi-Fi, for example. There are no leak protection options, and we saw no way to control notifications.iTop VPN has some privacy and security extras that we've not seen with other VPNs.A Security Reinforce module scanned our PC for weak or non-standard security settings, then suggested appropriate changes. You'll need some technical knowledge to understand its report, but the advice looks good to us, and is likely to improve your system security.The Browser Privacy feature can check and clear your browsing tracks in Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Opera and even Internet Explorer.These tools aren't the best we've seen, and they're maybe not all suitable for a VPN. Most providers use their own DNS servers rather than OpenVPN or Google, for instance, as that ensures no one else gets to see the sites you visit.But there's also more power here than we expected. DNS Protection isn't something iTop VPN threw together in an afternoon, for instance – it's an IObit feature taken direct from IObit Malware Fighter. Put it all together and the extras could have some value for more experienced users. (Although, as with the main app interface, we'd be happier if the developer sorted out the core features before starting with piling on the extras.)iTop VPN apps have specialist locations for unblocking many platforms, making them far easier to use than many competitors. If you're looking to unblock a supported platform in the US, say, you don't have to start choosing US locations until you find one that works: just choose a service from the list and you're ready to go.We tried this with BBC iPlayer, often a tricky site to unblock, but iTop VPN got us access right away.iTop VPN has Disney Plus locations in New York and Los Angeles. They both worked for us.There are streaming locations for Amazon Prime in the US and UK, but we weren't so lucky with these. Amazon spotted what we were doing, displayed its 'your device is connected to the internet using a VPN or proxy service' and demanded we 'disable it and try again.'It was the same disappointing story with Netflix: iTop VPN has a couple of specialist Netflix servers (US and Korea) but neither worked for us.Getting us into two of our four test sites isn't bad, but other providers do much better. CyberGhost, ExpressVPN, Hide.me, Hola, PrivadoVPN, Private Internet Access, ProtonVPN and Surfshark all unblocked every one of our test platforms in recent reviews.We measured iTop VPN speeds from US and UK locations with a 1Gbps connection in both cases, using several performance testing sites and services (SpeedTest's website and command line app, nPerf, SpeedOfme and more). We checked the download speeds at least five times from each site, and then we repeated all the tests in an evening session.UK download speeds were very ordinary at 180-190Mbps, but US performance was much better, with peak median speeds of around 360-400Mps, even reaching 900Mbps at one point. We're skeptical about that peak score, as it only happened in a single session out of the 20 we ran in the US, and none of the others got near even half that speed. We think the 360-400Mbps figure is more representative of what you're likely to see.That's not a bad result, and it's a close match with the OpenVPN performance we see from the likes of HideMyAss! (270-410Mbps) and TunnelBear (330-350Mbps).iTop's results lag well behind many other VPNs, though, especially when they're using WireGuard and faster protocols (providers such as CyberGhost, IPVanish and NordVPN regularly hit 750-900Mbps).There's another issue, too. That 330-350Mbps we saw from TunnelBear was using a standard OpenVPN connection with a very well-understood level of encryption and security. But iTop VPN uses the company's own custom protocol, which means we can't be sure these figures are a fair comparison. If iTop VPN is using more basic encryption, for instance, that might give it a big performance advantage, but at the cost of some security.iTop VPN has a stack of powerful extras, but it misses on a lot of the VPN fundamentals: there is no OpenVPN or WireGuard, limited unblocking, a flawed kill switch, plus various privacy issues. Its 700MB per day (21GB a month) free plan might be worth considering, but we wouldn't use it for anything privacy-critical.Mike began his career as a lead software developer in the engineering world, where his creations were used by big-name companies from Rolls Royce to British Nuclear Fuels and British Aerospace. He now covers VPNs, antivirus and all things security for TechRadar, although he still has a secret love of quirky open-source and freeware apps which find brand new ways to solve common problems.Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!Thank you for signing up to TechRadar.

<title>Workable review | TechRadar</title>
<content>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more By Mike Jennings 12 November 2021 While Workable provides plenty of features for recruitment, many rivals go a bit further with their respective offerings.While Workable provides plenty of features for recruitment, many rivals go a bit further with their respective offerings.Workable is a dedicated recruitment platform and Applicant Tracking System and it doesn’t tie into a wider suite of HR products, so it’s got a focused and well-designed range of features.It’s not the cheapest recruitment solution around, though, so it’s going to have to impress if businesses are going to find room for Workable in their budgets.Workable’s features are divided into three strands – the first sources and attracts candidates, the second handles evaluation and interviews, and the third tackles hiring.Workable has one-click job posting to more than 200 job boards, and it integrates with your company’s social media channels so you can advertise your own vacancies. You can also use Workable’s own drag-and-drop system to build your corporate careers page, and job applications from various sources are collated into a single pipeline for easier management.Lots of the processes can be automated, too. Workable’s AI systems supply a list of up to 50 potential candidates when you post a new job – you don’t even have to wait for the resumes to roll in. This service can automatically create social adverts for your positions, and Workable’s Chrome extension can deliver in-depth candidate information based on their social media profiles.Recruiters can also use Workable’s powerful Boolean search options to find suitable candidates. Workable has internal application options and an employee referral platform that can include unique sharing links and referral rewards.Switch over to the evaluation and interview module, and you’ll find more helpful features. You can use more than 700 job description templates that are SEO-optimized, and you can customize your hiring pipeline for consistency and familiarity.The service supports two-way syncing with Gmail and Outlook accounts to help recruiters and candidates stay on the same page, and Workable has an app to allow staff to manage recruitment on the move. Elsewhere, you’ll find collaborative tools that can be used by your whole HR team and in-built support for video interviews, and you can automate candidate communication. Anonymized candidate screening enables more inclusive hiring, and you can assess candidates using skillset, personality, and cognitive ability tests – and then see all the data so you can make informed hiring decisions.Further automation streamlines the hiring process, and you can use a central workflow and timeline to keep staff abreast of hiring processes and budgets. Workable has built-in offer letters and electronic signatures, and Workable also supports national, international, and local regulations to help your company be fully compliant.Workable also integrates with software from Microsoft, Google, Facebook, and LinkedIn, and can also be used with HR tools from Glassdoor, Bamboo, and Indeed. Ultimately, there are dozens of third-party integrations here for products that handle video interviews, assessments, referrals, sourcing, and every other part of the recruitment process.Workable does have a broad range of features, but large companies may want more customization and abilities from an HR product that handles more than just the recruitment process. Workable also misses out on automated reference checking, and it doesn’t have any onboarding options beyond the ability to offer jobs to candidates.Workable’s software is divided into four different products. The Paygo option costs $99 per job posted per month, and it has Workable’s essential features but few of the advanced options – it’s billed as a self-service choice for companies that only hire occasionally.The Core, Growth, and Premier options supply added functionality – the Core option builds on the PayGo service, the Growth tier adds automation options and extra features alongside a dedicated account manager, and the Premier option unlocks every feature alongside bespoke onboarding for the service in your business.Workable doesn’t list the pricing for those three products, though. You’ll have to get in touch with the company and work out costs based on your company’s size and needs.Workable is a straightforward recruitment tool with a good range of features that deliver a well-balanced approach across the entire recruitment process.It’s particularly useful for small and medium-sized businesses who need recruitment software to integrate with other HR services they may use. Still, larger companies with their own HR staff or full-service third-party options may not find this dedicated product necessary.We've also featured the best recruitment platforms, best HR software and best background check servicesSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!Thank you for signing up to TechRadar.

<title>Host Europe web hosting review | TechRadar</title>
<content>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more By Mike Williams , Mirza Bahic 12 November 2021 Host Europe is a strong, stable, and feature-packed web hosting provider geared towards German-speaking customers. If you fall into this category, don’t hesitate to give them a chance.Host Europe is a strong, stable, and feature-packed web hosting provider geared towards German-speaking customers. If you fall into this category, don’t hesitate to give them a chance.Established in 1997 in Germany, Host Europe has become and remained rather successful since, continuing to offer web hosting solutions for individuals, small and medium-sized businesses. They say that their primary objective is to provide their customers with internet and server hosting with the highest quality possible. This rings true if we consider that they’ve collected more than a couple of rewards throughout the years.In the Readers' Choice Host Europe was voted as the best service provider of 2019, the second-best in 2020, and a second-best in the cloud hosting category. They were also awarded gold three times at the Hosting & Service Provider Summits and received other awards by HOSTtest.de and from the test portal CHIP for best-in-class accessibility.Host Europe was one among the brands of HEG (Host Europe Group), a web hosting, email, and domain name registrar giant founded in 1997, same as its subsidiary. In December 2016, HEG was acquired by GoDaddy, and its name is slowly being phased out if the news holds true. However, this shouldn’t impact Host Europe in any significant way.Host Europe is headquartered in Cologne and has two “energy-saving and secure” data centers in Cologne and Strasbourg. If you wish to find out more about these two, the “Technology” section on their website provides plenty of information on the matter.The official site of Host Europe looks and feels old-fashioned, although not necessarily in a bad way since it makes finding your way around rather simple. The site is available in German and English language and it features a good-looking blog, which, unfortunately, isn’t translated into English.You can find Host Europe on Facebook (which is in English although the articles linked there are often in German), and Twitter (which is openly exclusive to its German-speaking followers). Host Europe's solutions include shared hosting, WordPress hosting, ecommerce hosting, VPS, reseller hosting, and dedicated server hosting, as well as domain name registration, SSL certificates, backup storage, site security, Microsoft 365 tools, professional email, and a website builder.Although Host Europe's hosting plans are affordable in general, which of them you get to choose from depends on whether you want to pay on a monthly or an annual basis. The price is identical but if you want to commit for one month only you’ll also have to pay a €14.99 ($17.30) one-off setup fee.Regardless of the billing cycle, for €4.99 ($5.75) per month, the “Basic” plan will supply you with one annual domain, SSL, 50GB of storage space, two MySQL databases, one automated mailbox migration (included in the first 30 days), and Kaspersky virus protection. More expensive plans won’t add further features but increase the amount of storage space, the number of databases, and the number of antivirus software solutions.While Host Europe doesn’t offer a money-back guarantee, you can cancel your contract with them within four weeks.As for payment methods, Host Europe accepts all major credit cards, PayPal, and SEPA direct debit. To create an account with Host Europe you’ll have to provide your full name, phone number, email, and physical address, and think up a strong password. Here, you can choose whether you want to be contacted via email, phone, or both. Depending on your choice, you’ll receive an order confirmation via message or email together, containing extremely detailed explanations of the features you can expect to receive, the cancellation policy, and the General Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy.After adding your payment details and making a purchase, you’ll be transferred to Host Europe’s dashboard, which (unfortunately for non-German users) suffers from an incomplete translation to English. To be fair, most important information is fully translated to English, but there are still parts in German, including the FAQ section accessible through the dashboard.Since Host Europe is not the swiftest of providers, you may have to hang around for a while before finding out whether your order was accepted or not. If yes, you’ll still have to provide additional information about your order before you can start using the product you've purchased. As of late, Host Europe provides user-friendly cPanel with its Linux-based products, and Plesk is available with the Windows hosting packages - the two most popular control panels in the industry. As for website building, in addition to a whole variety of CMS options (WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, and so on), ecommerce apps (Magento, Blestan, OpenCart, and more), community building tools (phpBB, Booked, Dada Mail, and so forth) and other useful apps you can easily install via Installatron, you’ll also get a bare-bones version of a beginner-friendly website builder. To get more of everything (sites, webspace per site, templates, email accounts, and so forth) you’ll have to purchase one of the bigger website builder plans as an add-on. After putting Host Europe’s official site to the GTmetrix speed test, we got average results altogether. The time it took for the site to fully load was an amazing 1.3 seconds but all other vital speed measuring metrics (largest contentful paint, total blocking time, and cumulative layout shift) got trapped in the abyss of averageness pulling the final score down to B (74%).When it comes to uptime, Host Europe guarantees an availability of its data centers at 99.95% as a monthly mean, with the exclusion of scheduled (and unscheduled) maintenance windows. This can be translated into 4.5 hours of downtime annually, or about 10 minutes for two weeks.After monitoring the uptime of Host Europe's official site via UptimeRobot for two weeks, we recorded a worrying 55 minutes of downtime which dragged the total uptime to 99.76%, meaning that we should be getting some sweet credit as compensation.If you find yourself in need of a helping hand, you can try reaching Host Europe's team via email, fax, live chat, and, if you’re in a rush, around-the-clock telephone number. The toll-free numbers are available for users from Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, as well as the “order hotline” which is reachable Monday to Friday, from 9 AM to 5 PM. There is even Host Europe's postal address if you feel like writing them an old-fashioned letter and recalling the “old days”. Alternatively, you can browse their “Forms and documents” section for questions related to terms of service, and it is available both in English and German. There is also a well-equipped FAQ section (it’s closer to a knowledge base), but it still isn’t translated into English, which means all users who don’t understand German are left to fend for themselves. Unfortunately, there is no community forum as a final resort before reaching the support personnel. If you want a well-rounded host that will give you more than enough time to decide whether you want to stay with them or part your ways, HostGator may be worth a look. Besides offering an ample 45-day money-back guarantee, it is also geared towards English-speaking users making itself more attractive to an international market than Host Europe.Another US-based alternative to Host Europe is Bluehost, a host that is known for its pocket-friendly pricing and not particularly pocket-friendly price spike after the promotional period. Although with Host Europe there is a one-off setup fee with all monthly plans, at least you won’t have to worry about any sudden price spikes.If you are looking for a simple solution from Germany aimed at personal sites or small businesses, a Berlin-based Strato might be worth a try. Although their scope of hosting solution seems somewhat limited, all their plans support multiple-domain hosting, come with a free domain, a free SSL certificate, plenty of one-click installs, a website builder, and a 30-day “no quibble” money-back guarantee. Unlike Host Europe, Strato doesn’t offer a monthly billing option, although the one you get with Host Europe will set you back with a one-off setup fee.Hostinger is one of the most popular hosts from Europe. It offers its users an access to its servers which are found all around the world including the Americas, Europe, and Asia. Thanks to its 14-day “observation” period you can try out everything for yourselves without a need to worry about your budget. Unfortunately, you will not get such a chance with Host Europe.Host Europe is an award-winning veteran from Germany trusted by over 250.000 customers as we write, and the number keeps on growing. If you can come to terms with data centers in Germany and France (kind of), self-help options being in German only, somewhat sluggish sign-up procedure, and considerable one-off setup fees (with monthly plans), be sure to give Host Europe a chance. If not, HostGator or Bluehost might be a better choice. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!Thank you for signing up to TechRadar.

<title>Atlas VPN review | TechRadar</title>

Learn more By Mike Williams 12 November 2021 Atlas VPN misses in some areas with its underpowered apps and feeble support site, but there's also plenty to like – it's P2P friendly, with great WireGuard-powered download speeds and no device limits for a very, very low price. Factor in the experience it'll gain after being acquired by NordVPN, and we think Atlas only gets better from.Atlas VPN misses in some areas with its underpowered apps and feeble support site, but there's also plenty to like – it's P2P friendly, with great WireGuard-powered download speeds and no device limits for a very, very low price. Factor in the experience it'll gain after being acquired by NordVPN, and we think Atlas only gets better from.Atlas VPN is a capable VPN provider which offers a decent all-round service for some of the lowest prices around.There's support for the speedy WireGuard protocol, for instance. You get apps for Windows, Mac, iOS and Android, a kill switch to protect you if the VPN drops, and the service allows unlimited simultaneous connections.A SafeSwap feature changes your IP address regularly while you're connected to the same server, maximizing your anonymity.Bonus features include ad and malware blocking, while data breach monitoring alerts you if any of your personal details are found on the dark web.Atlas VPN's network is smaller than many, with 700 servers spread across 27 countries. It'll be enough for many users, though, and P2P is supported everywhere.The really interesting news here came in October 2021, when Nord Security (the company behind NordVPN) announced it had acquired Atlas VPN. That tells you, all on its own, that Atlas isn't just another identikit VPN provider: there's some substance here, something worth buying. And although Atlas VPN will continue as an independent provider, it'll surely benefit in future from Nord Security's resources and experience.Atlas VPN's free no-registration-required plan gives you an easy way to try out the service, though with a couple of significant limits: 400MB per day for data, and three locations only (Amsterdam, New York, Los Angeles).That's not bad, and outperforms the free competition in some areas. Avira's Phantom VPN limits you to 500MB a month, for instance. Avast One's VPN has a generous 5GB a week data allowance, but doesn't support changing locations. ProtonVPN's free offering still wins out for its unlimited data and 12 locations.Opting for a paid plan drops the data and location limits. Prices start at an average $9.99 for monthly billing, and you can pay by card, PayPal and Google Pay. Upgrade to an annual account and the price plummets to just $2.49 a month, while the three-year plan is an amazing $1.39 a month (okay, only for the first term, and it's $3.99 on renewal, but that still looks like a good deal to us).Too good to be true? We'll check that later, but if you sign up and are unhappy, you're protected by a 30-day money-back guarantee.Beware, though: plans automatically renew when you sign up, and there's no way to change this or cancel your account from the control panel. You must email support and ask for help.Atlas VPN has the privacy basics covered with its WireGuard support, AES-256 encryption, kill switch and private DNS system.Unusual extras like rotating IP addresses along with ad and tracker-blocking should bring extra privacy protection.Atlas VPN's own policies aren't as impressive. Access its website for the first time and its cookie disclaimer only has an 'Accept' option, for instance. If you give the company your email address, you're opted in to receive marketing emails unless you specifically say otherwise. And the Blacklight Privacy Inspector found the site used Google Analytics, Facebook and assorted other tracking technologies.(Don't take our or Blacklight's word for it – even Atlas VPN's anti-tracker technology decided it was best to block three trackers on its own website.)Atlas VPN has been through what it calls an independent security audit, but this is just about as limited as we've seen.The exercise only covered the iOS app, for instance. It was a black box review, which means the auditors tested the functionality of the app, but didn't see the source code. And although Atlas VPN quoted some of the results in a blog post, it hasn't published the full report, so there's no way to judge it for ourselves.Okay, this is better than nothing, but only just, and it can't match the best of the competition. TunnelBear has annual audits of its apps, servers and backend infrastructure, for instance, and publishes the results for everyone to see.Atlas VPN claims to have a 'solid no-logs policy', saying 'we do not collect details on our users' activities, DNS queries, or other data that could be linked to our users.'The privacy policy says Atlas VPN's apps collect some device data, though. This includes: 'device type, model, brand name (e.g. Samsung, Apple), OS version, device ID, language, time zone, coarse location (city scale).'It also mentions using 'attribution analytics to track install source and traffic source', and 'advertising IDs to measure performance of our campaigns.'Put it all together and there's nothing to indicate Atlas VPN logs any of your online activities. It does have enough data to build user profiles, though, including details on user devices, when they connect and the amount of data they use. And as Atlas VPN hasn't had its no logging claims audited, there's no independent evidence to tell us if it's living up to its promises.The Windows app is basic, and covers only the VPN fundamentals: a location list of cities, a Connect/Disconnect button, and a handful of settings. (The latter consists of a 'Start on launch' option, an On/Off toggle for the kill switch, and a choice of WireGuard or IKEv2 protocols.)The developer hasn't paid much attention to usability. The location list covers cities, for instance, but they're not grouped by country or sorted in any order we could recognize. ('Germany, Serbia, USA - New Jersey, Hong Kong, Poland, Japan' is a part of the sequence – can you see any pattern?)There's no Favorites system or Recently Used list, either, so changing location is always going to require some scrolling.Our connection attempts failed sometimes with the free Atlas servers, perhaps a sign that they're overloaded. But this wasn't an issue once we upgraded, and connection times were decent at an average 5-6 seconds.Atlas claims its app has malware and ad blocking. There's no sign of this in the app itself, though, and it made no visible difference to us. We saw far better results by installing the free uBlock Origin.Our kill switch tests began with us simulating a dropped VPN. The good news is the kill switch immediately blocked our internet, ensuring we couldn't use the unprotected connection. The bad news – well, where to begin?The app didn't raise an alert when the VPN failed, for instance. It didn't try to reconnect, either. In a real-world situation you might easily waste time checking networks, rebooting your device, or even the router, before you figured out why your internet was down.Usually we could restore normal operations by hitting the Connect button. Sometimes this failed, though, with the app recommending we turned off the kill switch. What, it even blocked its own internet access? Really?We reluctantly agreed to turn the kill switch off, and the app then connected. But when we checked Settings, the kill switch was still marked as on – it hadn't been disabled, after all.Confused? Us too. Overall, the kill switch protected us from dropped connections, and that's what matters most. But the app could do a lot more to keep users informed, and get the VPN up and running again at the maximum possible speed.Desktop VPN apps normally beat their mobile VPN cousins for features, but not here. Atlas VPN's Android app outperforms its Windows offering in several areas.The location list works as expected, for instance, with countries grouped by continent and sorted alphabetically.There's a separate list of Streaming Servers, apparently optimized to reduce buffering, something not included on the desktop build.Settings are essentially the same as Windows, including a kill switch and support for WireGuard and IKEv2 protocols.An Assistant page hosts a tracker blocking feature and the Data Breach Monitor, more options that we couldn't find on Windows. We ran a quick check of these, and found they offered some value. Turning on tracker blocking protected us from some trackers, and entering an email into the Data Breach Monitor listed some of the breaches where our credentials were exposed.Atlas VPN's iOS app also improves on the Windows client with its sensibly sorted location list, tracker blocking and Data Breach Monitor options. It's a little short on features, though, with no WireGuard support or kill switch.Atlas VPN's support website is a little limited, and that's putting it politely. There are very few articles, most don't cover the topics you need, and many of what's left only have a few lines of content.The Troubleshooting section is a great example. We hoped to see some sound general advice on installation problems, issues with app features or download speeds. Instead, we found only four articles on very specific issues, such as 'How to fix error 13801 on Windows?' and 'What if my PC does not support Atlas VPN 64-bit?'(And if you're expecting any depth with the help provided, prepare for disappointment. This is the entire and unedited answer to that last question: 'No need to worry if your Windows device does not support Atlas VPN 64-bit: you can download the 32-bit version here.')Atlas VPN has no live chat support, but you can contact the company via email. We sent a message with a couple of simple product questions. Does the Windows app have tracker blocking? And which, if any of the apps block malicious websites or ads, as none of them mention it anywhere?A reply arrived just over two hours later, not bad for a response time.The message read: 'The mentioned features are currently being tested, therefore they are not available on all platforms. They should be rolled out to other OS'es soon, however, we are unable to provide an exact ETA as it may be misleading.'As Atlas VPN couldn't tell us which apps support malicious website or ad blocking, we'll assume the feature isn't available yet. That might have changed by the time you read this, but if it's a priority for you, ask the company before you sign up.Atlas VPN hadn't always impressed us so far, but it got off to a great unblocking start by getting us into BBC iPlayer.Accessing US Amazon was more difficult than usual, as it asked us to complete a CAPTCHA first. IP reputation service IPQualityScore revealed that our Atlas server IP address had a fraud rating of 100, with recent abuse reported. That's not anything directly to do with Atlas VPN, but it suggests the free plan and low prices might make the company especially appealing to hackers. That makes for more blacklisted IPs, and could mean more CAPTCHAS and other security hassles for you.Once we'd accessed US Amazon Prime, though, Atlas allowed us to stream content right away. We moved on to Disney Plus and were able to access that site, too.US Netflix is the jewel in the unblocking crown, though, and it was out of Atlas VPN's reach. We weren't able to view content from any of Atlas VPN's US servers.We measure VPN performance by running several benchmarking services – SpeedTest's website and command line app, SpeedOf.me, nPerf – from both a UK data center and a US residential location. We run each benchmark five times using WireGuard and OpenVPN (where available), run them a second time several hours later (that's a minimum of 120 tests), then analyze the data to see what's going on.Atlas VPN doesn't support OpenVPN, but its IKEv2 speeds were reasonable at a mid-range 260-320Mpps in the US, 170-210Mbps in the UK.Switching to WireGuard made a big difference, though, with speeds jumping to 590-600Mbps in the UK, and 650-800Mbps in the US. That's not quite a performance leader – NordVPN peaked at 880Mbps, IPVanish at 900Mbps – but it beat names like Windscribe (430-480Mbps), StrongVPN (450Mbps) and Surfshark (450-475Mbps).Atlas VPN may not have the best network, or apps, or support site – for those, you'd have to go for a more established provider like ExpressVPN. But now it's owned by Nord Security, we'd expect to see some improvements. And even right now, Atlas VPN's speeds are good, it unblocks more sites than many, and the three-year plan is as cheap as you'll see anywhere.Mike began his career as a lead software developer in the engineering world, where his creations were used by big-name companies from Rolls Royce to British Nuclear Fuels and British Aerospace.

<title>Calendar.com review | TechRadar</title>
<content>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more By Stefan Ionescu 11 November 2021 Calendar.com is a long-standing name on the market for calendar apps, and its developers have put a lot of effort into making it a good, well-rounded solution. The interface is very light on the eyes and works smoothly, and the app itself offers lots of different features aimed at users with specific needs. It comes in several pricing tiers – including a free one – that allow users to pick the version that best matches their individual preferences. Calendar.com is a long-standing name on the market for calendar apps, and its developers have put a lot of effort into making it a good, well-rounded solution. The interface is very light on the eyes and works smoothly, and the app itself offers lots of different features aimed at users with specific needs. It comes in several pricing tiers – including a free one – that allow users to pick the version that best matches their individual preferences. If you’ve spent some time looking for a good calendar app, you’ve probably noticed that the market tends to be divided into two main categories. On one hand, we have apps aimed at individual users, offering a small but solid set of features that fit most needs. On the other hand, there are also the more advanced, professional calendar apps that offer lots of features and are designed to work best in large organizations.Calendar.com is a little bit of both, with features that can make it an attractive choice for regular home users, while also offering a competent professional package suitable for organizations of different sizes. The app is offered on multiple platforms as well, making it one of the most versatile offers on the market at the moment. Users can easily check out the free version and then upgrade to one of the premium tiers, and it doesn’t take long to set it up on different devices.There are three plans available – Free, Standard ($6/month), and Pro ($8/month). The free plan comes with pretty much everything one might need for regular daily use, and doesn’t lock any critical features behind a paywall, unlike some competing apps. Users on this tier can connect to one calendar on an external platform, and will have one basic workspace to use. It’s worth noting that up to five members can be added to a single workspace, even on a free tier, which makes the app better for collaboration for those who don’t want to pay for a premium solution.The two premium tiers add a variety of extra features aimed primarily at users in organizations. This includes the ability to sync more calendars under a single account, unlimited workspace members, meetings with 25 and even 50 guests, and analytics that can help you gain a deeper understanding of your scheduling habits. Calendar.com comes with all standard features you would expect to find in a modern calendar app. You can view your schedule in different modes – day/week/month/year, and can easily share your calendar with other users, including those on Google services. Free users can set up meetings with up to 5 attendants, and the app offers advanced scheduling options to help you find the best available timeslot.Some of the features offered by Calendar.com can’t be found in other similar apps, or at least not often – such as the ability to embed calendars in web pages, and the native Zapier integration. Zoom integration is available as well, though only on the premium tiers. For most individual users, this shouldn’t matter much, but for those planning to use Calendar.com in an organization, subscribing to one of the premium tiers will be a good idea. The interface of Calendar.com doesn’t shine with anything unusual, but it gets the job done more or less fine. The app leans towards a more minimalistic design, hiding elements that are not used frequently and focusing on the major parts of the interface. That said, you should find it very easy to dig up any feature you might need, and it doesn’t take long to get used to the way the interface is organized.The app does tend to flow a bit better with a premium subscription, mainly because it unlocks its full range of features. The free tier still has its benefits though – especially for those looking for simplicity and a clean design. Some users might find the additional features in the premium tiers confusing, since many of them are aimed at organizations and similar use cases. Give the free version a try before deciding to upgrade to a premium plan, as it might work just fine for your specific needs.The company provides standard email support on top of their help knowledge base, and they additionally offer some special options to premium subscribers. If you’re on the Standard or Pro tier, you can get in touch with support representatives over the phone, and your inquiries will be prioritized. Free users will still get support, but in a more limited capacity. Most of the problems you may encounter during your use of the app should already be covered in the knowledgebase in any case.Calendar.com manages to stand out with its set of features and pricing plans. The app faces direct competition from Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, and other popular solutions like Fantastical. It still has a dedicated user base, and some have been with it for many years at this point. Choosing between Calendar.com and some of its popular competitors is mostly about personal choice with regards to things like interface organization and pricing, and the app is definitely worth checking out if you’re currently comparing the different options on the market.The app does a great job on all fronts, and can be equally useful to individuals as well as large organizations. It takes some time to get used to how it works, but after that, everything is quite easy. The strong support it receives from its developers is nothing but a huge plus as well, so if you’re looking for a good calendar app that covers all important bases at a reasonable price, look no further.We've also featured the best calendar apps and best time management appsStefan has always been a lover of tech.

<title>FastVPN review | TechRadar</title>
<content>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more By Mike Williams 12 November 2021 Seriously cheap for the first year, but you can see why: the desktop apps are unreliable, and there are very features. For unblocking Netflix and basic tasks only.Seriously cheap for the first year, but you can see why: the desktop apps are unreliable, and there are very features. For unblocking Netflix and basic tasks only.FastVPN is a simple VPN owned by Namecheap, the popular domain registrar and web hosting service.If you're wondering why you should trust a domain registrar to run your VPN, good question. No need to worry, though; it's using servers run by an arm of StackPath, which has also provided the network for major VPN brands such as IPVanish and StrongVPN.Whoever owns the network, it's a decent size, with 1,000+ P2P-friendly servers spread across 75+ locations worldwide. Apps are available for Windows, Mac, iOS and Android; tutorials show how to set up the service on Linux and various routers, and, unusually, there are no annoying limits on the number of devices you can connect at one time.The feature list is basic, though, covering the bare essentials only. You get OpenVPN and IKEv2 protocol support (no WireGuard), secure DNS to reduce the chance of DNS leaks, a kill switch to block internet access if the VPN drops, and that's about it.FastVPN's starting prices are some of the lowest around, thanks to big discounts off your first term.Sign up for the monthly plan, for instance, and you'll pay nothing at all for the first month, effectively a 30-day free trial, rising to a still-excellent $5.88 on renewal.The annual plan is just $1 a month for year one, rising to $2.88 on renewal. There are no longer-term plans (the old three-year option has disappeared.)These are very low first-term prices (and they're pretty good on renewal, too). Private Internet Access is one of our go-to VPNs for value, but with monthly plans at $9.95, dropping to $3.33 paid annually, it's still no match for FastVPN.If you are tempted, you're able to by card or PayPal, and there's a 30-day money-back guarantee to protect you if it all goes wrong.The FastVPN website comments briefly on logging, saying you'll "keep your browsing activities to yourself with our strict no-log policy" and that the service "won’t track, collect, or share any of your logs". We searched the website for something more detailed, without any luck. The only extra information we found came from the Windows VPN app installer, which warned that it collected "aggregated anonymous app usage data, including your device and OS version so we can troubleshoot and improve our app", but "that's it", and that there's "no tracking of your personal identifiable information".We'd like a little more substance than that, and ideally a security or no-logging audit, but that doesn't seem likely to happen any time soon. FastVPN is targeted at the average consumer who wants something easy to use which 'just works', and not the kind of user who cares about session logging or whether it uses AES-256-CBC or GCM.FastVPN's Windows app opens with a default 'Best Available' server choice, and a 'Connect VPN' button. The client displays the name of your current network, too, a handy way to be sure you're connecting to the official coffee shop Wi-Fi, and not some shady open network nearby.A location picker to the left gives a list of countries (some with city-level choices), server load and ping time information (you can sort by those, too), simple Favorites system to easily group your most commonly used locations.Although this looked good in theory, real-world performance was poor. OpenVPN connections took up to 40 seconds, three to four times faster than we usually see, and IKEv2 connections were also poor at 18-20 seconds.That was just the start. Occasionally, after connecting, we found we couldn't access any websites. Sometimes the VPN dropped, complaining of various internal errors or that there was 'no network detected.' It didn't help that some of these error messages were layered on top of normal status information, making them difficult to read. Not a huge issue, but it all helps to create a poor impression of the app. We expect better from a big company such as Namecheap.Settings are relatively limited: auto-start options, a choice of protocol (IKEv2, OpenVPN TCP/ UDP, and a Scramble option to help bypass VPN blocking), and a kill switch to block internet access if the VPN drops.The app handled unexpected disconnects very well. We forcibly closed our IKEv2 connection, the app noticed, displayed a notification and reconnected at once. So, we closed the connection again, then kept closing it, as fast we could, interrupting every reconnect attempt. That's a level of stress testing which goes way beyond what you're likely to see in real life, but the app just waited until we'd finished, then reconnected as before.The kill switch generally worked well, too. Whatever we did to IKEv2 or OpenVPN connections, the app raised an alert, wasn't especially troubled by our extreme testing methods and reconnected as soon as it could, without ever leaving us unprotected. FastVPN's Android VPN app looks and feels very similar to the Windows edition: big green Connect button, by default you're connected to the nearest server, but you can choose something else from a searchable list of locations.We noticed small usability issues. The desktop app hides city locations by default, and they're only visible if you expand a specific country. The mobile app displays city and country names in the same list, so there's much more scrolling (and the cities aren't always displayed in alphabetical order, either.) Settings are basic, too, with protocol options reduced to OpenVPN UDP or TCP (no IKEv2, this time).FastVPN's iOS app is very similar, but does add one very useful feature. An Always On option enables automatically connecting to the VPN whenever you access untrusted networks, while also ignoring networks you know are safe (home, work, etc).These apps aren't bad, and they didn't have the technical issues we saw on the desktop. But they're also short on features, and can't begin to compete with the best VPNs.FastVPN doesn't make any specific claims about its website-unblocking abilities, but generally suggests it can help you 'securely unblock sites and content.'This certainly worked as a BBC iPlayer VPN, where FastVPN got us access with the first location we tried.The service scored an even big victory when it unblocked US Netflix, a task which defeats many big VPN names.But FastVPN couldn't keep up that level of success, and it failed with Amazon Prime Video and Disney+.That's not a bad result, but we've seen some providers do much better. CyberGhost, ExpressVPN, Hide.me, Private Internet Access, ProtonVPN and Surfshark all unblocked everything in their latest reviews.We measured FastVPN speeds from a UK data center with excellent connectivity and a 1Gbps connection, giving us room to see exactly what the service could do.FastVPN turned out to be not so fast after all, with both OpenVPN and IKEv2 speeds reaching a modest 250Mbps. That's better than some - NordVPN and IPVanish didn't reach 200Mbps with OpenVPN - but a long way behind OpenVPN leaders such as HideMyAss! (340-350Mbps), Hide.me (390Mbps) and ProtonVPN (400-460Mbps.)There's another problem. OpenVPN is the fastest protocol FastVPN supports, but most providers give you much more capable options. IPVanish's WireGuard connections hit 750-900Mbps in recent reviews, for instance, while NordVPN's NordLynx was a close match at 760-880Mbps.So despite the name, there's no chance this service will appear in our list of the truly fastest VPNs. But although FastVPN trails far behind in the speed stakes, it's also far from the worst we've seen, and the service should handle most browsing or streaming tasks with ease.FastVPN's ultra-low starter prices caught our eye, but the Windows app was unreliable and there are very few features. Could work as a cheap VPN for unblocking Netflix and other basic tasks, but this isn't the service for experienced or demanding users. Assuming you want something better, we'd suggest going for our #1 rated ExpressVPN or, to save on costs, the also brilliant Surfshark.Mike began his career as a lead software developer in the engineering world, where his creations were used by big-name companies from Rolls Royce to British Nuclear Fuels and British Aerospace.

<title>Zoho Recruit review | TechRadar</title>
<content>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more By Mike Jennings 12 November 2021 Zoho Recruit offers excellent features that are easy to use though this recruitment tool can be expensive for smaller businesses.Zoho Recruit offers excellent features that are easy to use though this recruitment tool can be expensive for smaller businesses.Zoho Recruit is one of the biggest Applicant Tracking System (ATS) services in the world, so it’s going to be right at the top of most people’s lists if they need some help with their hunt for top-quality staff.There’s plenty going for Zoho Recruit, including a free option and a broad range of features. Still, we’ve also got questions about some of the firm’s support options and integration abilities.Zoho Recruit has a broad range of features that are divided into three kinds of product – one for companies, another for recruitment agencies and a third for people who need to hire temporary staff.The Corporate HR product allows you to post job openings to hundreds of different mainstream and niche job boards, and you can boost job listings on social networks. You can also search through resumes with AI-powered modules that will find candidates on your behalf. You can set up a dedicated resume inbox and invite recruiters to submit potential candidates through a portal with your own branding. You can also establish an employee referral portal to allow your existing staff to give recommendations.Zoho’s AI features are robust and impressive. Applicants can be graded in advance based on your preferred traits and requirements, and advanced searches help narrow down the candidate pool.You can use Zoho’s background screening module to run background checks so you can adhere to your preferred hiring practices, and you can ask candidates to complete pre-screening assessments to help eliminate unsuitable people and streamline the process.HR staff and candidates can access dedicated portals to track the status of applications, and Zoho allows you to track recruitment stats and analyze data. Thanks to a customized series of alerts, rules, and actions, corporate HR staff can also automate much of the recruitment process. Impressively, Zoho’s entire experience can be customized, from the branding and aesthetic of the software to custom tabs and layout options.Switch over to Zoho’s agency module, and you get the same features alongside options to have powerful client portals that allow agency clients to create vacancies easily, send feedback and invite people to interview. And if you use Zoho’s temporary staff product, you’ll receive help from straightforward and powerful scheduling and timesheet tools alongside electronic signatures and invoicing to speed up laborious parts of the process. Temporary workers can also access their own portal to mark their availability and view their workloads.Zoho does have good features, but some things are missing here too. Zoho Recruit has integrations with Outlook, LinkedIn, Google Suite, and a selection of other products and services, but you’ll find more integration ability elsewhere.This service doesn’t have as many behavioral, skill, and cognitive testing options as some other recruitment services, either. You only get 24/7 support if you pay extra, too – standard plans only have support five days of the week.Zoho’s broader company offers a full range of HR products, which is excellent if you want to pick and choose features or opt for a more comprehensive HR solution. Sadly, though, that means you don’t get onboarding unless you pay more.Zoho’s standard Corporate HR package costs $25 per month if you buy annually, and you get the service’s core features alongside candidate sourcing, resume management, tracking, and Google, Zoho, and Microsoft Outlook integrations. If you buy the $50 per month Enterprise product, you get AI-powered candidate matching, improvement portal management, and advanced customization. On top of that, you’ll need to pay extra for hiring manager and vendor portal licenses.Recruitment agencies can pay for $25, $50, and $75 tiers, with the two latter options adding extra features. That $50 choice adds AI matching, advanced analytics, better security control, portal management, and candidate assessment options. The top-tier service adds more customization and portal options.The temporary employee package has a simple, single price of $59 a month, although you’ll have to pay more if you want to hire more than 25 employees.Zoho Recruit’s three products also have free tiers that give you candidate management, interview scheduling, and simple resume search options alongside other basic features. Still, these options are restrictive – HR departments can only list one vacancy at a time, and the temporary staff package is limited to five people.Zoho Recruit has an impressive selection of features, no matter which package you choose. It doesn’t require a huge amount of technical knowledge to use and excels when it comes to customization and AI-powered extras. It offers a broad slate of recruitment options for HR departments, temporary staff needs, and agencies, and it can be easily incorporated into a wider HR product if necessary.The costs can mount up, especially if you want a full HR or recruitment solution, and you may want to look elsewhere if you need more testing options, extension integration, or better support.For most companies and agencies, though, Zoho Recruit will prove excellent, and is one of the recruitment services you need to consider.We've also featured the best recruitment platforms, best HR software and best background check servicesSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!Thank you for signing up to TechRadar.

<title>iTop VPN | TechRadar</title>
<content>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more By Mike Williams 12 November 2021 iTop VPN's generous 700MB/day (21GB/month) free plan might be worth a look for simple, non-privacy-critical tasks, but the service has too many fundamental issues to justify handing over your cash.iTop VPN's generous 700MB/day (21GB/month) free plan might be worth a look for simple, non-privacy-critical tasks, but the service has too many fundamental issues to justify handing over your cash.iTop VPN is a free VPN service with an affordable paid plan and one or two unusual privacy extras.The free plan gives you 700MB of data per day (21GB per month), and a choice of 16 locations (including the US and UK), easily beating most of the competition.Paying for a subscription gets you access to 100+ locations and 1,800+ streaming and gaming-optimized servers. (P2P is supported, too, though only on a handful of specialist servers.)A longer-than-usual list of bonus features include split tunneling, along with ad, tracker and malware blocking, browser history cleaning, and a Security Reinforce tool checks your device privacy settings and warns of any problems.iTop VPN has apps for Windows, Mac (a recent addition), Android and iOS, and support for connecting up to five devices simultaneously.This VPN's monthly plan is priced at $11.99, not the highest we've seen, but more expensive than most.Paying six months upfront cuts the cost to $6.99 a month, but that's still above average. You're paying iTop $41.94 to get your six months of cover, for instance, but Private Internet Access only asks $39.95 for a full year ($3.33 a month).iTop isn't done yet, though. Opt for its annual plan and you'll get an extra year thrown in, giving you two year's protection for $2.31 a month. A handful of providers are even cheaper – Private Internet Access has a three-year plan for $2.19 a month, Ivacy and PrivadoVPN go even lower – but that still looks like a real bargain.iTop supports payments via card, PayPal and bank transfers. It's good to see that you can turn off auto-renewal when you purchase the service, too, ensuring you won't accidentally pay for a second term that you don't want.Even better, if you're unhappy, a 15-day 'no questions asked' money-back guarantee (7 days for monthly-billed plans) means you're able to get your first payment back, too.Most VPNs protect your privacy by using secure VPN protocols such as WireGuard and OpenVPN. This doesn't guarantee you'll be safe – a provider can easily make mistakes in how they're set up – but they're open source, so anyone can see how they work or check the code for problems.However, iTop uses a custom scheme of its own. The Windows app appears to make a fast proxy connection to the VPN server, then uses an open source package called WinDivert to direct your traffic through the tunnel, apparently encrypting it with iTop's own protocol.Maybe this is secure, maybe it's not, but the company doesn't provide enough information to judge. You can't check the encryption it uses, for instance.We noticed a separate privacy issue on the iTop VPN website. Its SSL certificate wasn't properly configured, and this allowed us to access areas of the site, including the Login page, using an unencrypted HTTP connection. Unless you're using the VPN, that risks exposing your credentials to snoopers.iTop scores another privacy thumbs-down for its order form, where it insisted we entered our full name, city and post or ZIP code. A tooltip tried to justify this by saying that the details 'allow us to contact you if there are any issues with your order.' Uh, isn't that what our email address is for?iTop VPN claims to have a no logging policy, and the privacy policy spells out what this means.The company does its best to sound reassuring, telling users: 'We do not log your activity while you are utilizing the Services, including your browsing history, the bandwidth you used, or how long you connected to VPN servers. We do not store your original IP address or the server IP address that you connect to.'Sounds good, but we already know this can't be entirely true. iTop VPN limits its free plan to 700MB a day, so to make this work it must log the bandwidth you use and associate it with a device ID.Scroll down the page and you'll find a 'What information we collect' section, which could also include a lot of data: '...operating system, device ID, Internet protocol addresses, browser type, browser language, referring/exit pages, clickstream data of our websites and our products or services, and the pages or features of our software or services accessed by you and the time spent there.'Some of that looks like it's referring to the website, not iTop's apps, but the fact that we're left to guess is a problem. A privacy policy should be clear and precise, not leave us with more questions than it answers.Whatever you think of iTop VPN's claims, the real problem here is the company hasn't had them confirmed by any kind of security or logging audit. We're left to take iTop on trust, and hope the firm is delivering what it promises.iTop VPN's apps look good and are stuffed with features, but also score poorly on many of the usability fundamentals.Hitting a big red Connect button should by default automatically connect you to the nearest server, for instance. But even though we were testing from the UK, the free app regularly connected us to Japan, and the paid plan sometimes chose Germany.An 'All Servers' list enables switching to another location, but this also isn't as easy as it should be. For example, the countries aren't sorted by name, continent, distance or any other order we could recognize (there are sequences like Korea, Russia, UK, Italy, Singapore and so on). And there's no Favorites system or Recently Used lists to help out.The app is missing some usability shortcuts we commonly see elsewhere. You can't double click a location name to connect, for instance – you must click a location's Connect button, instead. When the app does connect (or disconnect), there's no notification to alert you, so you won't know whether you're protected unless you keep an eye on the app interface.On the plus side, you get separate Streaming, Social and Gaming lists where you can view locations optimized for specific platforms (PUBG, Warzone, Netflix, Disney Plus, Amazon Prime, iPlayer, Hulu and more).Too much scrolling? The Quick Access pane lists 17 common reasons for using a VPN: Browse Privacy, Hide Location, Watch Netflix, Play PUBG, Unblock WhatsApp (or Telegram, Facebook, Twitter etc), and more. If you're looking to unblock Netflix, there's no need to scan down a lengthy list of servers and try to guess which is best: just tap 'Watch Netflix' and the app automatically chooses a location for you.These work well, and we like the flexibility. But we'd prefer iTop VPN to sort out some of the interface basics before it layers on any more extras.iTop VPN's Mac app mostly looks like the Windows build, but with a few very noticeable changes.There's no Downloading section, for instance – the P2P locations are in the 'All Servers' lists. The Quick Tasks section doesn't have a Play PUBG tile. There's no kill switch and no Settings menu (the Protocols list is now on the main screen). If you regularly use both the Windows and Mac apps, the differences could be a little confusing.The iOS app is all about simplicity, with no Settings menu, no kill switch, no P2P, no HTTPS protocol option, and absolutely no bonus privacy tools. Instead, you just get the location lists, a big Connect button and a choice of TCP/UDP protocols.There's good news in one iOS area. Cities are grouped into countries, making for a shorter and better-organized list. But it's still not sorted alphabetically (and to make it worse, the iOS app uses a different order to the Windows build).The Android app is essentially the iOS version with added split tunneling, and yet another sort order for the servers list. Not a big deal unless you're using iTop VPN on several platforms – only then will you need to remember where your favorite locations appear on each device.iTop VPN supports a kill switch to stop internet traffic if the VPN drops unexpectedly. We found the Windows app was mostly successful, but had some flaws. When we forcibly crashed the app, for instance, our VPN connection dropped, the kill switch didn't kick in, and our traffic was unprotected. And as the app doesn't raise any notifications, an affected user is unlikely to realize they're at risk in such a scenario.Split tunneling support allows you to decide which apps use the tunnel, and which don't. It's handy if you only need the VPN to unblock a couple of websites, say, as other apps can use your normal (and faster) connection. This worked well for us, directing only browsers through the VPN by default, but making it easy to add other apps as required.A DNS Protection feature claims to protect your DNS settings from modification by malware. You can also set your DNS to one of several public DNS providers, simply by choosing them from a list: Google, OpenDNS, Verizon, Comodo and DNS Advantage.The app has a handful of settings. You're able to launch it when Windows starts, optionally connect, and choose one of three protocol options: UDP, TCP and HTTPS. As iTop VPN doesn't use any standard VPN protocol, it's not completely clear what the effects of these settings might be, and the descriptions don't help much. (Choosing TCP apparently gets you 'high level privacy', for instance, while opting for UDP means faster speeds but 'more data usage for special occasions.')iTop VPN is also missing some of the more advanced settings we see with other apps. It won't automatically connect when you access insecure Wi-Fi, for example. There are no leak protection options, and we saw no way to control notifications.iTop VPN has some privacy and security extras that we've not seen with other VPNs.A Security Reinforce module scanned our PC for weak or non-standard security settings, then suggested appropriate changes. You'll need some technical knowledge to understand its report, but the advice looks good to us, and is likely to improve your system security.The Browser Privacy feature can check and clear your browsing tracks in Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Opera and even Internet Explorer.These tools aren't the best we've seen, and they're maybe not all suitable for a VPN. Most providers use their own DNS servers rather than OpenVPN or Google, for instance, as that ensures no one else gets to see the sites you visit.But there's also more power here than we expected. DNS Protection isn't something iTop VPN threw together in an afternoon, for instance – it's an IObit feature taken direct from IObit Malware Fighter. Put it all together and the extras could have some value for more experienced users. (Although, as with the main app interface, we'd be happier if the developer sorted out the core features before starting with piling on the extras.)iTop VPN apps have specialist locations for unblocking many platforms, making them far easier to use than many competitors. If you're looking to unblock a supported platform in the US, say, you don't have to start choosing US locations until you find one that works: just choose a service from the list and you're ready to go.We tried this with BBC iPlayer, often a tricky site to unblock, but iTop VPN got us access right away.iTop VPN has Disney Plus locations in New York and Los Angeles. They both worked for us.There are streaming locations for Amazon Prime in the US and UK, but we weren't so lucky with these. Amazon spotted what we were doing, displayed its 'your device is connected to the internet using a VPN or proxy service' and demanded we 'disable it and try again.'It was the same disappointing story with Netflix: iTop VPN has a couple of specialist Netflix servers (US and Korea) but neither worked for us.Getting us into two of our four test sites isn't bad, but other providers do much better. CyberGhost, ExpressVPN, Hide.me, Hola, PrivadoVPN, Private Internet Access, ProtonVPN and Surfshark all unblocked every one of our test platforms in recent reviews.We measured iTop VPN speeds from US and UK locations with a 1Gbps connection in both cases, using several performance testing sites and services (SpeedTest's website and command line app, nPerf, SpeedOfme and more). We checked the download speeds at least five times from each site, and then we repeated all the tests in an evening session.UK download speeds were very ordinary at 180-190Mbps, but US performance was much better, with peak median speeds of around 360-400Mps, even reaching 900Mbps at one point. We're skeptical about that peak score, as it only happened in a single session out of the 20 we ran in the US, and none of the others got near even half that speed. We think the 360-400Mbps figure is more representative of what you're likely to see.That's not a bad result, and it's a close match with the OpenVPN performance we see from the likes of HideMyAss! (270-410Mbps) and TunnelBear (330-350Mbps).iTop's results lag well behind many other VPNs, though, especially when they're using WireGuard and faster protocols (providers such as CyberGhost, IPVanish and NordVPN regularly hit 750-900Mbps).There's another issue, too. That 330-350Mbps we saw from TunnelBear was using a standard OpenVPN connection with a very well-understood level of encryption and security. But iTop VPN uses the company's own custom protocol, which means we can't be sure these figures are a fair comparison. If iTop VPN is using more basic encryption, for instance, that might give it a big performance advantage, but at the cost of some security.iTop VPN has a stack of powerful extras, but it misses on a lot of the VPN fundamentals: there is no OpenVPN or WireGuard, limited unblocking, a flawed kill switch, plus various privacy issues. Its 700MB per day (21GB a month) free plan might be worth considering, but we wouldn't use it for anything privacy-critical.Mike began his career as a lead software developer in the engineering world, where his creations were used by big-name companies from Rolls Royce to British Nuclear Fuels and British Aerospace.

<title>Workable review | TechRadar</title>
<content>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more By Mike Jennings 12 November 2021 While Workable provides plenty of features for recruitment, many rivals go a bit further with their respective offerings.While Workable provides plenty of features for recruitment, many rivals go a bit further with their respective offerings.Workable is a dedicated recruitment platform and Applicant Tracking System and it doesn’t tie into a wider suite of HR products, so it’s got a focused and well-designed range of features.It’s not the cheapest recruitment solution around, though, so it’s going to have to impress if businesses are going to find room for Workable in their budgets.Workable’s features are divided into three strands – the first sources and attracts candidates, the second handles evaluation and interviews, and the third tackles hiring.Workable has one-click job posting to more than 200 job boards, and it integrates with your company’s social media channels so you can advertise your own vacancies. You can also use Workable’s own drag-and-drop system to build your corporate careers page, and job applications from various sources are collated into a single pipeline for easier management.Lots of the processes can be automated, too. Workable’s AI systems supply a list of up to 50 potential candidates when you post a new job – you don’t even have to wait for the resumes to roll in. This service can automatically create social adverts for your positions, and Workable’s Chrome extension can deliver in-depth candidate information based on their social media profiles.Recruiters can also use Workable’s powerful Boolean search options to find suitable candidates. Workable has internal application options and an employee referral platform that can include unique sharing links and referral rewards.Switch over to the evaluation and interview module, and you’ll find more helpful features. You can use more than 700 job description templates that are SEO-optimized, and you can customize your hiring pipeline for consistency and familiarity.The service supports two-way syncing with Gmail and Outlook accounts to help recruiters and candidates stay on the same page, and Workable has an app to allow staff to manage recruitment on the move. Elsewhere, you’ll find collaborative tools that can be used by your whole HR team and in-built support for video interviews, and you can automate candidate communication. Anonymized candidate screening enables more inclusive hiring, and you can assess candidates using skillset, personality, and cognitive ability tests – and then see all the data so you can make informed hiring decisions.Further automation streamlines the hiring process, and you can use a central workflow and timeline to keep staff abreast of hiring processes and budgets. Workable has built-in offer letters and electronic signatures, and Workable also supports national, international, and local regulations to help your company be fully compliant.Workable also integrates with software from Microsoft, Google, Facebook, and LinkedIn, and can also be used with HR tools from Glassdoor, Bamboo, and Indeed. Ultimately, there are dozens of third-party integrations here for products that handle video interviews, assessments, referrals, sourcing, and every other part of the recruitment process.Workable does have a broad range of features, but large companies may want more customization and abilities from an HR product that handles more than just the recruitment process. Workable also misses out on automated reference checking, and it doesn’t have any onboarding options beyond the ability to offer jobs to candidates.Workable’s software is divided into four different products. The Paygo option costs $99 per job posted per month, and it has Workable’s essential features but few of the advanced options – it’s billed as a self-service choice for companies that only hire occasionally.The Core, Growth, and Premier options supply added functionality – the Core option builds on the PayGo service, the Growth tier adds automation options and extra features alongside a dedicated account manager, and the Premier option unlocks every feature alongside bespoke onboarding for the service in your business.Workable doesn’t list the pricing for those three products, though. You’ll have to get in touch with the company and work out costs based on your company’s size and needs.Workable is a straightforward recruitment tool with a good range of features that deliver a well-balanced approach across the entire recruitment process.It’s particularly useful for small and medium-sized businesses who need recruitment software to integrate with other HR services they may use. Still, larger companies with their own HR staff or full-service third-party options may not find this dedicated product necessary.We've also featured the best recruitment platforms, best HR software and best background check servicesSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!Thank you for signing up to TechRadar.

<title>Host Europe web hosting review | TechRadar</title>
<content>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more By Mike Williams , Mirza Bahic 12 November 2021 Host Europe is a strong, stable, and feature-packed web hosting provider geared towards German-speaking customers. If you fall into this category, don’t hesitate to give them a chance.Host Europe is a strong, stable, and feature-packed web hosting provider geared towards German-speaking customers. If you fall into this category, don’t hesitate to give them a chance.Established in 1997 in Germany, Host Europe has become and remained rather successful since, continuing to offer web hosting solutions for individuals, small and medium-sized businesses. They say that their primary objective is to provide their customers with internet and server hosting with the highest quality possible. This rings true if we consider that they’ve collected more than a couple of rewards throughout the years.In the Readers' Choice Host Europe was voted as the best service provider of 2019, the second-best in 2020, and a second-best in the cloud hosting category. They were also awarded gold three times at the Hosting & Service Provider Summits and received other awards by HOSTtest.de and from the test portal CHIP for best-in-class accessibility.Host Europe was one among the brands of HEG (Host Europe Group), a web hosting, email, and domain name registrar giant founded in 1997, same as its subsidiary. In December 2016, HEG was acquired by GoDaddy, and its name is slowly being phased out if the news holds true. However, this shouldn’t impact Host Europe in any significant way.Host Europe is headquartered in Cologne and has two “energy-saving and secure” data centers in Cologne and Strasbourg. If you wish to find out more about these two, the “Technology” section on their website provides plenty of information on the matter.The official site of Host Europe looks and feels old-fashioned, although not necessarily in a bad way since it makes finding your way around rather simple. The site is available in German and English language and it features a good-looking blog, which, unfortunately, isn’t translated into English.You can find Host Europe on Facebook (which is in English although the articles linked there are often in German), and Twitter (which is openly exclusive to its German-speaking followers). Host Europe's solutions include shared hosting, WordPress hosting, ecommerce hosting, VPS, reseller hosting, and dedicated server hosting, as well as domain name registration, SSL certificates, backup storage, site security, Microsoft 365 tools, professional email, and a website builder.Although Host Europe's hosting plans are affordable in general, which of them you get to choose from depends on whether you want to pay on a monthly or an annual basis. The price is identical but if you want to commit for one month only you’ll also have to pay a €14.99 ($17.30) one-off setup fee.Regardless of the billing cycle, for €4.99 ($5.75) per month, the “Basic” plan will supply you with one annual domain, SSL, 50GB of storage space, two MySQL databases, one automated mailbox migration (included in the first 30 days), and Kaspersky virus protection. More expensive plans won’t add further features but increase the amount of storage space, the number of databases, and the number of antivirus software solutions.While Host Europe doesn’t offer a money-back guarantee, you can cancel your contract with them within four weeks.As for payment methods, Host Europe accepts all major credit cards, PayPal, and SEPA direct debit. To create an account with Host Europe you’ll have to provide your full name, phone number, email, and physical address, and think up a strong password. Here, you can choose whether you want to be contacted via email, phone, or both. Depending on your choice, you’ll receive an order confirmation via message or email together, containing extremely detailed explanations of the features you can expect to receive, the cancellation policy, and the General Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy.After adding your payment details and making a purchase, you’ll be transferred to Host Europe’s dashboard, which (unfortunately for non-German users) suffers from an incomplete translation to English. To be fair, most important information is fully translated to English, but there are still parts in German, including the FAQ section accessible through the dashboard.Since Host Europe is not the swiftest of providers, you may have to hang around for a while before finding out whether your order was accepted or not. If yes, you’ll still have to provide additional information about your order before you can start using the product you've purchased. As of late, Host Europe provides user-friendly cPanel with its Linux-based products, and Plesk is available with the Windows hosting packages - the two most popular control panels in the industry. As for website building, in addition to a whole variety of CMS options (WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, and so on), ecommerce apps (Magento, Blestan, OpenCart, and more), community building tools (phpBB, Booked, Dada Mail, and so forth) and other useful apps you can easily install via Installatron, you’ll also get a bare-bones version of a beginner-friendly website builder. To get more of everything (sites, webspace per site, templates, email accounts, and so forth) you’ll have to purchase one of the bigger website builder plans as an add-on. After putting Host Europe’s official site to the GTmetrix speed test, we got average results altogether. The time it took for the site to fully load was an amazing 1.3 seconds but all other vital speed measuring metrics (largest contentful paint, total blocking time, and cumulative layout shift) got trapped in the abyss of averageness pulling the final score down to B (74%).When it comes to uptime, Host Europe guarantees an availability of its data centers at 99.95% as a monthly mean, with the exclusion of scheduled (and unscheduled) maintenance windows. This can be translated into 4.5 hours of downtime annually, or about 10 minutes for two weeks.After monitoring the uptime of Host Europe's official site via UptimeRobot for two weeks, we recorded a worrying 55 minutes of downtime which dragged the total uptime to 99.76%, meaning that we should be getting some sweet credit as compensation.If you find yourself in need of a helping hand, you can try reaching Host Europe's team via email, fax, live chat, and, if you’re in a rush, around-the-clock telephone number. The toll-free numbers are available for users from Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, as well as the “order hotline” which is reachable Monday to Friday, from 9 AM to 5 PM. There is even Host Europe's postal address if you feel like writing them an old-fashioned letter and recalling the “old days”. Alternatively, you can browse their “Forms and documents” section for questions related to terms of service, and it is available both in English and German. There is also a well-equipped FAQ section (it’s closer to a knowledge base), but it still isn’t translated into English, which means all users who don’t understand German are left to fend for themselves. Unfortunately, there is no community forum as a final resort before reaching the support personnel. If you want a well-rounded host that will give you more than enough time to decide whether you want to stay with them or part your ways, HostGator may be worth a look. Besides offering an ample 45-day money-back guarantee, it is also geared towards English-speaking users making itself more attractive to an international market than Host Europe.Another US-based alternative to Host Europe is Bluehost, a host that is known for its pocket-friendly pricing and not particularly pocket-friendly price spike after the promotional period. Although with Host Europe there is a one-off setup fee with all monthly plans, at least you won’t have to worry about any sudden price spikes.If you are looking for a simple solution from Germany aimed at personal sites or small businesses, a Berlin-based Strato might be worth a try. Although their scope of hosting solution seems somewhat limited, all their plans support multiple-domain hosting, come with a free domain, a free SSL certificate, plenty of one-click installs, a website builder, and a 30-day “no quibble” money-back guarantee. Unlike Host Europe, Strato doesn’t offer a monthly billing option, although the one you get with Host Europe will set you back with a one-off setup fee.Hostinger is one of the most popular hosts from Europe. It offers its users an access to its servers which are found all around the world including the Americas, Europe, and Asia. Thanks to its 14-day “observation” period you can try out everything for yourselves without a need to worry about your budget. Unfortunately, you will not get such a chance with Host Europe.Host Europe is an award-winning veteran from Germany trusted by over 250.000 customers as we write, and the number keeps on growing. If you can come to terms with data centers in Germany and France (kind of), self-help options being in German only, somewhat sluggish sign-up procedure, and considerable one-off setup fees (with monthly plans), be sure to give Host Europe a chance. If not, HostGator or Bluehost might be a better choice. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!Thank you for signing up to TechRadar.

Learn more By Mike Williams 12 November 2021 Atlas VPN misses in some areas with its underpowered apps and feeble support site, but there's also plenty to like – it's P2P friendly, with great WireGuard-powered download speeds and no device limits for a very, very low price. Factor in the experience it'll gain after being acquired by NordVPN, and we think Atlas only gets better from.Atlas VPN misses in some areas with its underpowered apps and feeble support site, but there's also plenty to like – it's P2P friendly, with great WireGuard-powered download speeds and no device limits for a very, very low price. Factor in the experience it'll gain after being acquired by NordVPN, and we think Atlas only gets better from.Atlas VPN is a capable VPN provider which offers a decent all-round service for some of the lowest prices around.There's support for the speedy WireGuard protocol, for instance. You get apps for Windows, Mac, iOS and Android, a kill switch to protect you if the VPN drops, and the service allows unlimited simultaneous connections.A SafeSwap feature changes your IP address regularly while you're connected to the same server, maximizing your anonymity.Bonus features include ad and malware blocking, while data breach monitoring alerts you if any of your personal details are found on the dark web.Atlas VPN's network is smaller than many, with 700 servers spread across 27 countries. It'll be enough for many users, though, and P2P is supported everywhere.The really interesting news here came in October 2021, when Nord Security (the company behind NordVPN) announced it had acquired Atlas VPN. That tells you, all on its own, that Atlas isn't just another identikit VPN provider: there's some substance here, something worth buying. And although Atlas VPN will continue as an independent provider, it'll surely benefit in future from Nord Security's resources and experience.Atlas VPN's free no-registration-required plan gives you an easy way to try out the service, though with a couple of significant limits: 400MB per day for data, and three locations only (Amsterdam, New York, Los Angeles).That's not bad, and outperforms the free competition in some areas. Avira's Phantom VPN limits you to 500MB a month, for instance. Avast One's VPN has a generous 5GB a week data allowance, but doesn't support changing locations. ProtonVPN's free offering still wins out for its unlimited data and 12 locations.Opting for a paid plan drops the data and location limits. Prices start at an average $9.99 for monthly billing, and you can pay by card, PayPal and Google Pay. Upgrade to an annual account and the price plummets to just $2.49 a month, while the three-year plan is an amazing $1.39 a month (okay, only for the first term, and it's $3.99 on renewal, but that still looks like a good deal to us).Too good to be true? We'll check that later, but if you sign up and are unhappy, you're protected by a 30-day money-back guarantee.Beware, though: plans automatically renew when you sign up, and there's no way to change this or cancel your account from the control panel. You must email support and ask for help.Atlas VPN has the privacy basics covered with its WireGuard support, AES-256 encryption, kill switch and private DNS system.Unusual extras like rotating IP addresses along with ad and tracker-blocking should bring extra privacy protection.Atlas VPN's own policies aren't as impressive. Access its website for the first time and its cookie disclaimer only has an 'Accept' option, for instance. If you give the company your email address, you're opted in to receive marketing emails unless you specifically say otherwise. And the Blacklight Privacy Inspector found the site used Google Analytics, Facebook and assorted other tracking technologies.(Don't take our or Blacklight's word for it – even Atlas VPN's anti-tracker technology decided it was best to block three trackers on its own website.)Atlas VPN has been through what it calls an independent security audit, but this is just about as limited as we've seen.The exercise only covered the iOS app, for instance. It was a black box review, which means the auditors tested the functionality of the app, but didn't see the source code. And although Atlas VPN quoted some of the results in a blog post, it hasn't published the full report, so there's no way to judge it for ourselves.Okay, this is better than nothing, but only just, and it can't match the best of the competition. TunnelBear has annual audits of its apps, servers and backend infrastructure, for instance, and publishes the results for everyone to see.Atlas VPN claims to have a 'solid no-logs policy', saying 'we do not collect details on our users' activities, DNS queries, or other data that could be linked to our users.'The privacy policy says Atlas VPN's apps collect some device data, though. This includes: 'device type, model, brand name (e.g. Samsung, Apple), OS version, device ID, language, time zone, coarse location (city scale).'It also mentions using 'attribution analytics to track install source and traffic source', and 'advertising IDs to measure performance of our campaigns.'Put it all together and there's nothing to indicate Atlas VPN logs any of your online activities. It does have enough data to build user profiles, though, including details on user devices, when they connect and the amount of data they use. And as Atlas VPN hasn't had its no logging claims audited, there's no independent evidence to tell us if it's living up to its promises.The Windows app is basic, and covers only the VPN fundamentals: a location list of cities, a Connect/Disconnect button, and a handful of settings. (The latter consists of a 'Start on launch' option, an On/Off toggle for the kill switch, and a choice of WireGuard or IKEv2 protocols.)The developer hasn't paid much attention to usability. The location list covers cities, for instance, but they're not grouped by country or sorted in any order we could recognize. ('Germany, Serbia, USA - New Jersey, Hong Kong, Poland, Japan' is a part of the sequence – can you see any pattern?)There's no Favorites system or Recently Used list, either, so changing location is always going to require some scrolling.Our connection attempts failed sometimes with the free Atlas servers, perhaps a sign that they're overloaded. But this wasn't an issue once we upgraded, and connection times were decent at an average 5-6 seconds.Atlas claims its app has malware and ad blocking. There's no sign of this in the app itself, though, and it made no visible difference to us. We saw far better results by installing the free uBlock Origin.Our kill switch tests began with us simulating a dropped VPN. The good news is the kill switch immediately blocked our internet, ensuring we couldn't use the unprotected connection. The bad news – well, where to begin?The app didn't raise an alert when the VPN failed, for instance. It didn't try to reconnect, either. In a real-world situation you might easily waste time checking networks, rebooting your device, or even the router, before you figured out why your internet was down.Usually we could restore normal operations by hitting the Connect button. Sometimes this failed, though, with the app recommending we turned off the kill switch. What, it even blocked its own internet access? Really?We reluctantly agreed to turn the kill switch off, and the app then connected. But when we checked Settings, the kill switch was still marked as on – it hadn't been disabled, after all.Confused? Us too. Overall, the kill switch protected us from dropped connections, and that's what matters most. But the app could do a lot more to keep users informed, and get the VPN up and running again at the maximum possible speed.Desktop VPN apps normally beat their mobile VPN cousins for features, but not here. Atlas VPN's Android app outperforms its Windows offering in several areas.The location list works as expected, for instance, with countries grouped by continent and sorted alphabetically.There's a separate list of Streaming Servers, apparently optimized to reduce buffering, something not included on the desktop build.Settings are essentially the same as Windows, including a kill switch and support for WireGuard and IKEv2 protocols.An Assistant page hosts a tracker blocking feature and the Data Breach Monitor, more options that we couldn't find on Windows. We ran a quick check of these, and found they offered some value. Turning on tracker blocking protected us from some trackers, and entering an email into the Data Breach Monitor listed some of the breaches where our credentials were exposed.Atlas VPN's iOS app also improves on the Windows client with its sensibly sorted location list, tracker blocking and Data Breach Monitor options. It's a little short on features, though, with no WireGuard support or kill switch.Atlas VPN's support website is a little limited, and that's putting it politely. There are very few articles, most don't cover the topics you need, and many of what's left only have a few lines of content.The Troubleshooting section is a great example. We hoped to see some sound general advice on installation problems, issues with app features or download speeds. Instead, we found only four articles on very specific issues, such as 'How to fix error 13801 on Windows?' and 'What if my PC does not support Atlas VPN 64-bit?'(And if you're expecting any depth with the help provided, prepare for disappointment. This is the entire and unedited answer to that last question: 'No need to worry if your Windows device does not support Atlas VPN 64-bit: you can download the 32-bit version here.')Atlas VPN has no live chat support, but you can contact the company via email. We sent a message with a couple of simple product questions. Does the Windows app have tracker blocking? And which, if any of the apps block malicious websites or ads, as none of them mention it anywhere?A reply arrived just over two hours later, not bad for a response time.The message read: 'The mentioned features are currently being tested, therefore they are not available on all platforms. They should be rolled out to other OS'es soon, however, we are unable to provide an exact ETA as it may be misleading.'As Atlas VPN couldn't tell us which apps support malicious website or ad blocking, we'll assume the feature isn't available yet. That might have changed by the time you read this, but if it's a priority for you, ask the company before you sign up.Atlas VPN hadn't always impressed us so far, but it got off to a great unblocking start by getting us into BBC iPlayer.Accessing US Amazon was more difficult than usual, as it asked us to complete a CAPTCHA first. IP reputation service IPQualityScore revealed that our Atlas server IP address had a fraud rating of 100, with recent abuse reported. That's not anything directly to do with Atlas VPN, but it suggests the free plan and low prices might make the company especially appealing to hackers. That makes for more blacklisted IPs, and could mean more CAPTCHAS and other security hassles for you.Once we'd accessed US Amazon Prime, though, Atlas allowed us to stream content right away. We moved on to Disney Plus and were able to access that site, too.US Netflix is the jewel in the unblocking crown, though, and it was out of Atlas VPN's reach. We weren't able to view content from any of Atlas VPN's US servers.We measure VPN performance by running several benchmarking services – SpeedTest's website and command line app, SpeedOf.me, nPerf – from both a UK data center and a US residential location. We run each benchmark five times using WireGuard and OpenVPN (where available), run them a second time several hours later (that's a minimum of 120 tests), then analyze the data to see what's going on.Atlas VPN doesn't support OpenVPN, but its IKEv2 speeds were reasonable at a mid-range 260-320Mpps in the US, 170-210Mbps in the UK.Switching to WireGuard made a big difference, though, with speeds jumping to 590-600Mbps in the UK, and 650-800Mbps in the US. That's not quite a performance leader – NordVPN peaked at 880Mbps, IPVanish at 900Mbps – but it beat names like Windscribe (430-480Mbps), StrongVPN (450Mbps) and Surfshark (450-475Mbps).Atlas VPN may not have the best network, or apps, or support site – for those, you'd have to go for a more established provider like ExpressVPN. But now it's owned by Nord Security, we'd expect to see some improvements. And even right now, Atlas VPN's speeds are good, it unblocks more sites than many, and the three-year plan is as cheap as you'll see anywhere.Mike began his career as a lead software developer in the engineering world, where his creations were used by big-name companies from Rolls Royce to British Nuclear Fuels and British Aerospace.

<title>Calendar.com review | TechRadar</title>

Learn more By Stefan Ionescu 11 November 2021 Calendar.com is a long-standing name on the market for calendar apps, and its developers have put a lot of effort into making it a good, well-rounded solution. The interface is very light on the eyes and works smoothly, and the app itself offers lots of different features aimed at users with specific needs. It comes in several pricing tiers – including a free one – that allow users to pick the version that best matches their individual preferences. Calendar.com is a long-standing name on the market for calendar apps, and its developers have put a lot of effort into making it a good, well-rounded solution. The interface is very light on the eyes and works smoothly, and the app itself offers lots of different features aimed at users with specific needs. It comes in several pricing tiers – including a free one – that allow users to pick the version that best matches their individual preferences. If you’ve spent some time looking for a good calendar app, you’ve probably noticed that the market tends to be divided into two main categories. On one hand, we have apps aimed at individual users, offering a small but solid set of features that fit most needs. On the other hand, there are also the more advanced, professional calendar apps that offer lots of features and are designed to work best in large organizations.Calendar.com is a little bit of both, with features that can make it an attractive choice for regular home users, while also offering a competent professional package suitable for organizations of different sizes. The app is offered on multiple platforms as well, making it one of the most versatile offers on the market at the moment. Users can easily check out the free version and then upgrade to one of the premium tiers, and it doesn’t take long to set it up on different devices.There are three plans available – Free, Standard ($6/month), and Pro ($8/month). The free plan comes with pretty much everything one might need for regular daily use, and doesn’t lock any critical features behind a paywall, unlike some competing apps. Users on this tier can connect to one calendar on an external platform, and will have one basic workspace to use. It’s worth noting that up to five members can be added to a single workspace, even on a free tier, which makes the app better for collaboration for those who don’t want to pay for a premium solution.The two premium tiers add a variety of extra features aimed primarily at users in organizations. This includes the ability to sync more calendars under a single account, unlimited workspace members, meetings with 25 and even 50 guests, and analytics that can help you gain a deeper understanding of your scheduling habits. Calendar.com comes with all standard features you would expect to find in a modern calendar app. You can view your schedule in different modes – day/week/month/year, and can easily share your calendar with other users, including those on Google services. Free users can set up meetings with up to 5 attendants, and the app offers advanced scheduling options to help you find the best available timeslot.Some of the features offered by Calendar.com can’t be found in other similar apps, or at least not often – such as the ability to embed calendars in web pages, and the native Zapier integration. Zoom integration is available as well, though only on the premium tiers. For most individual users, this shouldn’t matter much, but for those planning to use Calendar.com in an organization, subscribing to one of the premium tiers will be a good idea. The interface of Calendar.com doesn’t shine with anything unusual, but it gets the job done more or less fine. The app leans towards a more minimalistic design, hiding elements that are not used frequently and focusing on the major parts of the interface. That said, you should find it very easy to dig up any feature you might need, and it doesn’t take long to get used to the way the interface is organized.The app does tend to flow a bit better with a premium subscription, mainly because it unlocks its full range of features. The free tier still has its benefits though – especially for those looking for simplicity and a clean design. Some users might find the additional features in the premium tiers confusing, since many of them are aimed at organizations and similar use cases. Give the free version a try before deciding to upgrade to a premium plan, as it might work just fine for your specific needs.The company provides standard email support on top of their help knowledge base, and they additionally offer some special options to premium subscribers. If you’re on the Standard or Pro tier, you can get in touch with support representatives over the phone, and your inquiries will be prioritized. Free users will still get support, but in a more limited capacity. Most of the problems you may encounter during your use of the app should already be covered in the knowledgebase in any case.Calendar.com manages to stand out with its set of features and pricing plans. The app faces direct competition from Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, and other popular solutions like Fantastical. It still has a dedicated user base, and some have been with it for many years at this point. Choosing between Calendar.com and some of its popular competitors is mostly about personal choice with regards to things like interface organization and pricing, and the app is definitely worth checking out if you’re currently comparing the different options on the market.The app does a great job on all fronts, and can be equally useful to individuals as well as large organizations. It takes some time to get used to how it works, but after that, everything is quite easy. The strong support it receives from its developers is nothing but a huge plus as well, so if you’re looking for a good calendar app that covers all important bases at a reasonable price, look no further.We've also featured the best calendar apps and best time management appsStefan has always been a lover of tech.

<title>FastVPN review | TechRadar</title>
<content>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more By Mike Williams 12 November 2021 Seriously cheap for the first year, but you can see why: the desktop apps are unreliable, and there are very features. For unblocking Netflix and basic tasks only.Seriously cheap for the first year, but you can see why: the desktop apps are unreliable, and there are very features. For unblocking Netflix and basic tasks only.FastVPN is a simple VPN owned by Namecheap, the popular domain registrar and web hosting service.If you're wondering why you should trust a domain registrar to run your VPN, good question. No need to worry, though; it's using servers run by an arm of StackPath, which has also provided the network for major VPN brands such as IPVanish and StrongVPN.Whoever owns the network, it's a decent size, with 1,000+ P2P-friendly servers spread across 75+ locations worldwide. Apps are available for Windows, Mac, iOS and Android; tutorials show how to set up the service on Linux and various routers, and, unusually, there are no annoying limits on the number of devices you can connect at one time.The feature list is basic, though, covering the bare essentials only. You get OpenVPN and IKEv2 protocol support (no WireGuard), secure DNS to reduce the chance of DNS leaks, a kill switch to block internet access if the VPN drops, and that's about it.FastVPN's starting prices are some of the lowest around, thanks to big discounts off your first term.Sign up for the monthly plan, for instance, and you'll pay nothing at all for the first month, effectively a 30-day free trial, rising to a still-excellent $5.88 on renewal.The annual plan is just $1 a month for year one, rising to $2.88 on renewal. There are no longer-term plans (the old three-year option has disappeared.)These are very low first-term prices (and they're pretty good on renewal, too). Private Internet Access is one of our go-to VPNs for value, but with monthly plans at $9.95, dropping to $3.33 paid annually, it's still no match for FastVPN.If you are tempted, you're able to by card or PayPal, and there's a 30-day money-back guarantee to protect you if it all goes wrong.The FastVPN website comments briefly on logging, saying you'll "keep your browsing activities to yourself with our strict no-log policy" and that the service "won’t track, collect, or share any of your logs". We searched the website for something more detailed, without any luck. The only extra information we found came from the Windows VPN app installer, which warned that it collected "aggregated anonymous app usage data, including your device and OS version so we can troubleshoot and improve our app", but "that's it", and that there's "no tracking of your personal identifiable information".We'd like a little more substance than that, and ideally a security or no-logging audit, but that doesn't seem likely to happen any time soon. FastVPN is targeted at the average consumer who wants something easy to use which 'just works', and not the kind of user who cares about session logging or whether it uses AES-256-CBC or GCM.FastVPN's Windows app opens with a default 'Best Available' server choice, and a 'Connect VPN' button. The client displays the name of your current network, too, a handy way to be sure you're connecting to the official coffee shop Wi-Fi, and not some shady open network nearby.A location picker to the left gives a list of countries (some with city-level choices), server load and ping time information (you can sort by those, too), simple Favorites system to easily group your most commonly used locations.Although this looked good in theory, real-world performance was poor. OpenVPN connections took up to 40 seconds, three to four times faster than we usually see, and IKEv2 connections were also poor at 18-20 seconds.That was just the start. Occasionally, after connecting, we found we couldn't access any websites. Sometimes the VPN dropped, complaining of various internal errors or that there was 'no network detected.' It didn't help that some of these error messages were layered on top of normal status information, making them difficult to read. Not a huge issue, but it all helps to create a poor impression of the app. We expect better from a big company such as Namecheap.Settings are relatively limited: auto-start options, a choice of protocol (IKEv2, OpenVPN TCP/ UDP, and a Scramble option to help bypass VPN blocking), and a kill switch to block internet access if the VPN drops.The app handled unexpected disconnects very well. We forcibly closed our IKEv2 connection, the app noticed, displayed a notification and reconnected at once. So, we closed the connection again, then kept closing it, as fast we could, interrupting every reconnect attempt. That's a level of stress testing which goes way beyond what you're likely to see in real life, but the app just waited until we'd finished, then reconnected as before.The kill switch generally worked well, too. Whatever we did to IKEv2 or OpenVPN connections, the app raised an alert, wasn't especially troubled by our extreme testing methods and reconnected as soon as it could, without ever leaving us unprotected. FastVPN's Android VPN app looks and feels very similar to the Windows edition: big green Connect button, by default you're connected to the nearest server, but you can choose something else from a searchable list of locations.We noticed small usability issues. The desktop app hides city locations by default, and they're only visible if you expand a specific country. The mobile app displays city and country names in the same list, so there's much more scrolling (and the cities aren't always displayed in alphabetical order, either.) Settings are basic, too, with protocol options reduced to OpenVPN UDP or TCP (no IKEv2, this time).FastVPN's iOS app is very similar, but does add one very useful feature. An Always On option enables automatically connecting to the VPN whenever you access untrusted networks, while also ignoring networks you know are safe (home, work, etc).These apps aren't bad, and they didn't have the technical issues we saw on the desktop. But they're also short on features, and can't begin to compete with the best VPNs.FastVPN doesn't make any specific claims about its website-unblocking abilities, but generally suggests it can help you 'securely unblock sites and content.'This certainly worked as a BBC iPlayer VPN, where FastVPN got us access with the first location we tried.The service scored an even big victory when it unblocked US Netflix, a task which defeats many big VPN names.But FastVPN couldn't keep up that level of success, and it failed with Amazon Prime Video and Disney+.That's not a bad result, but we've seen some providers do much better. CyberGhost, ExpressVPN, Hide.me, Private Internet Access, ProtonVPN and Surfshark all unblocked everything in their latest reviews.We measured FastVPN speeds from a UK data center with excellent connectivity and a 1Gbps connection, giving us room to see exactly what the service could do.FastVPN turned out to be not so fast after all, with both OpenVPN and IKEv2 speeds reaching a modest 250Mbps. That's better than some - NordVPN and IPVanish didn't reach 200Mbps with OpenVPN - but a long way behind OpenVPN leaders such as HideMyAss! (340-350Mbps), Hide.me (390Mbps) and ProtonVPN (400-460Mbps.)There's another problem. OpenVPN is the fastest protocol FastVPN supports, but most providers give you much more capable options. IPVanish's WireGuard connections hit 750-900Mbps in recent reviews, for instance, while NordVPN's NordLynx was a close match at 760-880Mbps.So despite the name, there's no chance this service will appear in our list of the truly fastest VPNs. But although FastVPN trails far behind in the speed stakes, it's also far from the worst we've seen, and the service should handle most browsing or streaming tasks with ease.FastVPN's ultra-low starter prices caught our eye, but the Windows app was unreliable and there are very few features. Could work as a cheap VPN for unblocking Netflix and other basic tasks, but this isn't the service for experienced or demanding users. Assuming you want something better, we'd suggest going for our #1 rated ExpressVPN or, to save on costs, the also brilliant Surfshark.Mike began his career as a lead software developer in the engineering world, where his creations were used by big-name companies from Rolls Royce to British Nuclear Fuels and British Aerospace.

Applicants can be graded in advance based on your preferred traits and requirements, and advanced searches help narrow down the candidate pool.You can use Zoho’s background screening module to run background checks so you can adhere to your preferred hiring practices, and you can ask candidates to complete pre-screening assessments to help eliminate unsuitable people and streamline the process.HR staff and candidates can access dedicated portals to track the status of applications, and Zoho allows you to track recruitment stats and analyze data. Thanks to a customized series of alerts, rules, and actions, corporate HR staff can also automate much of the recruitment process. Impressively, Zoho’s entire experience can be customized, from the branding and aesthetic of the software to custom tabs and layout options.Switch over to Zoho’s agency module, and you get the same features alongside options to have powerful client portals that allow agency clients to create vacancies easily, send feedback and invite people to interview. And if you use Zoho’s temporary staff product, you’ll receive help from straightforward and powerful scheduling and timesheet tools alongside electronic signatures and invoicing to speed up laborious parts of the process. Temporary workers can also access their own portal to mark their availability and view their workloads.Zoho does have good features, but some things are missing here too. Zoho Recruit has integrations with Outlook, LinkedIn, Google Suite, and a selection of other products and services, but you’ll find more integration ability elsewhere.This service doesn’t have as many behavioral, skill, and cognitive testing options as some other recruitment services, either. You only get 24/7 support if you pay extra, too – standard plans only have support five days of the week.Zoho’s broader company offers a full range of HR products, which is excellent if you want to pick and choose features or opt for a more comprehensive HR solution. Sadly, though, that means you don’t get onboarding unless you pay more.Zoho’s standard Corporate HR package costs $25 per month if you buy annually, and you get the service’s core features alongside candidate sourcing, resume management, tracking, and Google, Zoho, and Microsoft Outlook integrations. If you buy the $50 per month Enterprise product, you get AI-powered candidate matching, improvement portal management, and advanced customization. On top of that, you’ll need to pay extra for hiring manager and vendor portal licenses.Recruitment agencies can pay for $25, $50, and $75 tiers, with the two latter options adding extra features. That $50 choice adds AI matching, advanced analytics, better security control, portal management, and candidate assessment options. The top-tier service adds more customization and portal options.The temporary employee package has a simple, single price of $59 a month, although you’ll have to pay more if you want to hire more than 25 employees.Zoho Recruit’s three products also have free tiers that give you candidate management, interview scheduling, and simple resume search options alongside other basic features. Still, these options are restrictive – HR departments can only list one vacancy at a time, and the temporary staff package is limited to five people.Zoho Recruit has an impressive selection of features, no matter which package you choose. It doesn’t require a huge amount of technical knowledge to use and excels when it comes to customization and AI-powered extras. It offers a broad slate of recruitment options for HR departments, temporary staff needs, and agencies, and it can be easily incorporated into a wider HR product if necessary.The costs can mount up, especially if you want a full HR or recruitment solution, and you may want to look elsewhere if you need more testing options, extension integration, or better support.For most companies and agencies, though, Zoho Recruit will prove excellent, and is one of the recruitment services you need to consider.We've also featured the best recruitment platforms, best HR software and best background check servicesSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!Thank you for signing up to TechRadar.

<title>iTop VPN | TechRadar</title>
<content>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more By Mike Williams 12 November 2021 iTop VPN's generous 700MB/day (21GB/month) free plan might be worth a look for simple, non-privacy-critical tasks, but the service has too many fundamental issues to justify handing over your cash.iTop VPN's generous 700MB/day (21GB/month) free plan might be worth a look for simple, non-privacy-critical tasks, but the service has too many fundamental issues to justify handing over your cash.iTop VPN is a free VPN service with an affordable paid plan and one or two unusual privacy extras.The free plan gives you 700MB of data per day (21GB per month), and a choice of 16 locations (including the US and UK), easily beating most of the competition.Paying for a subscription gets you access to 100+ locations and 1,800+ streaming and gaming-optimized servers. (P2P is supported, too, though only on a handful of specialist servers.)A longer-than-usual list of bonus features include split tunneling, along with ad, tracker and malware blocking, browser history cleaning, and a Security Reinforce tool checks your device privacy settings and warns of any problems.iTop VPN has apps for Windows, Mac (a recent addition), Android and iOS, and support for connecting up to five devices simultaneously.This VPN's monthly plan is priced at $11.99, not the highest we've seen, but more expensive than most.Paying six months upfront cuts the cost to $6.99 a month, but that's still above average. You're paying iTop $41.94 to get your six months of cover, for instance, but Private Internet Access only asks $39.95 for a full year ($3.33 a month).iTop isn't done yet, though. Opt for its annual plan and you'll get an extra year thrown in, giving you two year's protection for $2.31 a month. A handful of providers are even cheaper – Private Internet Access has a three-year plan for $2.19 a month, Ivacy and PrivadoVPN go even lower – but that still looks like a real bargain.iTop supports payments via card, PayPal and bank transfers. It's good to see that you can turn off auto-renewal when you purchase the service, too, ensuring you won't accidentally pay for a second term that you don't want.Even better, if you're unhappy, a 15-day 'no questions asked' money-back guarantee (7 days for monthly-billed plans) means you're able to get your first payment back, too.Most VPNs protect your privacy by using secure VPN protocols such as WireGuard and OpenVPN. This doesn't guarantee you'll be safe – a provider can easily make mistakes in how they're set up – but they're open source, so anyone can see how they work or check the code for problems.However, iTop uses a custom scheme of its own. The Windows app appears to make a fast proxy connection to the VPN server, then uses an open source package called WinDivert to direct your traffic through the tunnel, apparently encrypting it with iTop's own protocol.Maybe this is secure, maybe it's not, but the company doesn't provide enough information to judge. You can't check the encryption it uses, for instance.We noticed a separate privacy issue on the iTop VPN website. Its SSL certificate wasn't properly configured, and this allowed us to access areas of the site, including the Login page, using an unencrypted HTTP connection. Unless you're using the VPN, that risks exposing your credentials to snoopers.iTop scores another privacy thumbs-down for its order form, where it insisted we entered our full name, city and post or ZIP code. A tooltip tried to justify this by saying that the details 'allow us to contact you if there are any issues with your order.' Uh, isn't that what our email address is for?iTop VPN claims to have a no logging policy, and the privacy policy spells out what this means.The company does its best to sound reassuring, telling users: 'We do not log your activity while you are utilizing the Services, including your browsing history, the bandwidth you used, or how long you connected to VPN servers. We do not store your original IP address or the server IP address that you connect to.'Sounds good, but we already know this can't be entirely true. iTop VPN limits its free plan to 700MB a day, so to make this work it must log the bandwidth you use and associate it with a device ID.Scroll down the page and you'll find a 'What information we collect' section, which could also include a lot of data: '...operating system, device ID, Internet protocol addresses, browser type, browser language, referring/exit pages, clickstream data of our websites and our products or services, and the pages or features of our software or services accessed by you and the time spent there.'Some of that looks like it's referring to the website, not iTop's apps, but the fact that we're left to guess is a problem. A privacy policy should be clear and precise, not leave us with more questions than it answers.Whatever you think of iTop VPN's claims, the real problem here is the company hasn't had them confirmed by any kind of security or logging audit. We're left to take iTop on trust, and hope the firm is delivering what it promises.iTop VPN's apps look good and are stuffed with features, but also score poorly on many of the usability fundamentals.Hitting a big red Connect button should by default automatically connect you to the nearest server, for instance. But even though we were testing from the UK, the free app regularly connected us to Japan, and the paid plan sometimes chose Germany.An 'All Servers' list enables switching to another location, but this also isn't as easy as it should be. For example, the countries aren't sorted by name, continent, distance or any other order we could recognize (there are sequences like Korea, Russia, UK, Italy, Singapore and so on). And there's no Favorites system or Recently Used lists to help out.The app is missing some usability shortcuts we commonly see elsewhere. You can't double click a location name to connect, for instance – you must click a location's Connect button, instead. When the app does connect (or disconnect), there's no notification to alert you, so you won't know whether you're protected unless you keep an eye on the app interface.On the plus side, you get separate Streaming, Social and Gaming lists where you can view locations optimized for specific platforms (PUBG, Warzone, Netflix, Disney Plus, Amazon Prime, iPlayer, Hulu and more).Too much scrolling? The Quick Access pane lists 17 common reasons for using a VPN: Browse Privacy, Hide Location, Watch Netflix, Play PUBG, Unblock WhatsApp (or Telegram, Facebook, Twitter etc), and more. If you're looking to unblock Netflix, there's no need to scan down a lengthy list of servers and try to guess which is best: just tap 'Watch Netflix' and the app automatically chooses a location for you.These work well, and we like the flexibility. But we'd prefer iTop VPN to sort out some of the interface basics before it layers on any more extras.iTop VPN's Mac app mostly looks like the Windows build, but with a few very noticeable changes.There's no Downloading section, for instance – the P2P locations are in the 'All Servers' lists. The Quick Tasks section doesn't have a Play PUBG tile. There's no kill switch and no Settings menu (the Protocols list is now on the main screen). If you regularly use both the Windows and Mac apps, the differences could be a little confusing.The iOS app is all about simplicity, with no Settings menu, no kill switch, no P2P, no HTTPS protocol option, and absolutely no bonus privacy tools. Instead, you just get the location lists, a big Connect button and a choice of TCP/UDP protocols.There's good news in one iOS area. Cities are grouped into countries, making for a shorter and better-organized list. But it's still not sorted alphabetically (and to make it worse, the iOS app uses a different order to the Windows build).The Android app is essentially the iOS version with added split tunneling, and yet another sort order for the servers list. Not a big deal unless you're using iTop VPN on several platforms – only then will you need to remember where your favorite locations appear on each device.iTop VPN supports a kill switch to stop internet traffic if the VPN drops unexpectedly. We found the Windows app was mostly successful, but had some flaws. When we forcibly crashed the app, for instance, our VPN connection dropped, the kill switch didn't kick in, and our traffic was unprotected. And as the app doesn't raise any notifications, an affected user is unlikely to realize they're at risk in such a scenario.Split tunneling support allows you to decide which apps use the tunnel, and which don't. It's handy if you only need the VPN to unblock a couple of websites, say, as other apps can use your normal (and faster) connection. This worked well for us, directing only browsers through the VPN by default, but making it easy to add other apps as required.A DNS Protection feature claims to protect your DNS settings from modification by malware. You can also set your DNS to one of several public DNS providers, simply by choosing them from a list: Google, OpenDNS, Verizon, Comodo and DNS Advantage.The app has a handful of settings. You're able to launch it when Windows starts, optionally connect, and choose one of three protocol options: UDP, TCP and HTTPS. As iTop VPN doesn't use any standard VPN protocol, it's not completely clear what the effects of these settings might be, and the descriptions don't help much. (Choosing TCP apparently gets you 'high level privacy', for instance, while opting for UDP means faster speeds but 'more data usage for special occasions.')iTop VPN is also missing some of the more advanced settings we see with other apps. It won't automatically connect when you access insecure Wi-Fi, for example. There are no leak protection options, and we saw no way to control notifications.iTop VPN has some privacy and security extras that we've not seen with other VPNs.A Security Reinforce module scanned our PC for weak or non-standard security settings, then suggested appropriate changes. You'll need some technical knowledge to understand its report, but the advice looks good to us, and is likely to improve your system security.The Browser Privacy feature can check and clear your browsing tracks in Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Opera and even Internet Explorer.These tools aren't the best we've seen, and they're maybe not all suitable for a VPN. Most providers use their own DNS servers rather than OpenVPN or Google, for instance, as that ensures no one else gets to see the sites you visit.But there's also more power here than we expected. DNS Protection isn't something iTop VPN threw together in an afternoon, for instance – it's an IObit feature taken direct from IObit Malware Fighter. Put it all together and the extras could have some value for more experienced users. (Although, as with the main app interface, we'd be happier if the developer sorted out the core features before starting with piling on the extras.)iTop VPN apps have specialist locations for unblocking many platforms, making them far easier to use than many competitors. If you're looking to unblock a supported platform in the US, say, you don't have to start choosing US locations until you find one that works: just choose a service from the list and you're ready to go.We tried this with BBC iPlayer, often a tricky site to unblock, but iTop VPN got us access right away.iTop VPN has Disney Plus locations in New York and Los Angeles. They both worked for us.There are streaming locations for Amazon Prime in the US and UK, but we weren't so lucky with these. Amazon spotted what we were doing, displayed its 'your device is connected to the internet using a VPN or proxy service' and demanded we 'disable it and try again.'It was the same disappointing story with Netflix: iTop VPN has a couple of specialist Netflix servers (US and Korea) but neither worked for us.Getting us into two of our four test sites isn't bad, but other providers do much better. CyberGhost, ExpressVPN, Hide.me, Hola, PrivadoVPN, Private Internet Access, ProtonVPN and Surfshark all unblocked every one of our test platforms in recent reviews.We measured iTop VPN speeds from US and UK locations with a 1Gbps connection in both cases, using several performance testing sites and services (SpeedTest's website and command line app, nPerf, SpeedOfme and more). We checked the download speeds at least five times from each site, and then we repeated all the tests in an evening session.UK download speeds were very ordinary at 180-190Mbps, but US performance was much better, with peak median speeds of around 360-400Mps, even reaching 900Mbps at one point. We're skeptical about that peak score, as it only happened in a single session out of the 20 we ran in the US, and none of the others got near even half that speed. We think the 360-400Mbps figure is more representative of what you're likely to see.That's not a bad result, and it's a close match with the OpenVPN performance we see from the likes of HideMyAss! (270-410Mbps) and TunnelBear (330-350Mbps).iTop's results lag well behind many other VPNs, though, especially when they're using WireGuard and faster protocols (providers such as CyberGhost, IPVanish and NordVPN regularly hit 750-900Mbps).There's another issue, too. That 330-350Mbps we saw from TunnelBear was using a standard OpenVPN connection with a very well-understood level of encryption and security. But iTop VPN uses the company's own custom protocol, which means we can't be sure these figures are a fair comparison. If iTop VPN is using more basic encryption, for instance, that might give it a big performance advantage, but at the cost of some security.iTop VPN has a stack of powerful extras, but it misses on a lot of the VPN fundamentals: there is no OpenVPN or WireGuard, limited unblocking, a flawed kill switch, plus various privacy issues. Its 700MB per day (21GB a month) free plan might be worth considering, but we wouldn't use it for anything privacy-critical.Mike began his career as a lead software developer in the engineering world, where his creations were used by big-name companies from Rolls Royce to British Nuclear Fuels and British Aerospace.

<title>Workable review | TechRadar</title>
<content>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more By Mike Jennings 12 November 2021 While Workable provides plenty of features for recruitment, many rivals go a bit further with their respective offerings.While Workable provides plenty of features for recruitment, many rivals go a bit further with their respective offerings.Workable is a dedicated recruitment platform and Applicant Tracking System and it doesn’t tie into a wider suite of HR products, so it’s got a focused and well-designed range of features.It’s not the cheapest recruitment solution around, though, so it’s going to have to impress if businesses are going to find room for Workable in their budgets.Workable’s features are divided into three strands – the first sources and attracts candidates, the second handles evaluation and interviews, and the third tackles hiring.Workable has one-click job posting to more than 200 job boards, and it integrates with your company’s social media channels so you can advertise your own vacancies. You can also use Workable’s own drag-and-drop system to build your corporate careers page, and job applications from various sources are collated into a single pipeline for easier management.Lots of the processes can be automated, too. Workable’s AI systems supply a list of up to 50 potential candidates when you post a new job – you don’t even have to wait for the resumes to roll in. This service can automatically create social adverts for your positions, and Workable’s Chrome extension can deliver in-depth candidate information based on their social media profiles.Recruiters can also use Workable’s powerful Boolean search options to find suitable candidates. Workable has internal application options and an employee referral platform that can include unique sharing links and referral rewards.Switch over to the evaluation and interview module, and you’ll find more helpful features. You can use more than 700 job description templates that are SEO-optimized, and you can customize your hiring pipeline for consistency and familiarity.The service supports two-way syncing with Gmail and Outlook accounts to help recruiters and candidates stay on the same page, and Workable has an app to allow staff to manage recruitment on the move. Elsewhere, you’ll find collaborative tools that can be used by your whole HR team and in-built support for video interviews, and you can automate candidate communication. Anonymized candidate screening enables more inclusive hiring, and you can assess candidates using skillset, personality, and cognitive ability tests – and then see all the data so you can make informed hiring decisions.Further automation streamlines the hiring process, and you can use a central workflow and timeline to keep staff abreast of hiring processes and budgets. Workable has built-in offer letters and electronic signatures, and Workable also supports national, international, and local regulations to help your company be fully compliant.Workable also integrates with software from Microsoft, Google, Facebook, and LinkedIn, and can also be used with HR tools from Glassdoor, Bamboo, and Indeed. Ultimately, there are dozens of third-party integrations here for products that handle video interviews, assessments, referrals, sourcing, and every other part of the recruitment process.Workable does have a broad range of features, but large companies may want more customization and abilities from an HR product that handles more than just the recruitment process. Workable also misses out on automated reference checking, and it doesn’t have any onboarding options beyond the ability to offer jobs to candidates.Workable’s software is divided into four different products. The Paygo option costs $99 per job posted per month, and it has Workable’s essential features but few of the advanced options – it’s billed as a self-service choice for companies that only hire occasionally.The Core, Growth, and Premier options supply added functionality – the Core option builds on the PayGo service, the Growth tier adds automation options and extra features alongside a dedicated account manager, and the Premier option unlocks every feature alongside bespoke onboarding for the service in your business.Workable doesn’t list the pricing for those three products, though. You’ll have to get in touch with the company and work out costs based on your company’s size and needs.Workable is a straightforward recruitment tool with a good range of features that deliver a well-balanced approach across the entire recruitment process.It’s particularly useful for small and medium-sized businesses who need recruitment software to integrate with other HR services they may use. Still, larger companies with their own HR staff or full-service third-party options may not find this dedicated product necessary.We've also featured the best recruitment platforms, best HR software and best background check servicesSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!Thank you for signing up to TechRadar.

<title>Host Europe web hosting review | TechRadar</title>
<content>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more By Mike Williams , Mirza Bahic 12 November 2021 Host Europe is a strong, stable, and feature-packed web hosting provider geared towards German-speaking customers. If you fall into this category, don’t hesitate to give them a chance.Host Europe is a strong, stable, and feature-packed web hosting provider geared towards German-speaking customers. If you fall into this category, don’t hesitate to give them a chance.Established in 1997 in Germany, Host Europe has become and remained rather successful since, continuing to offer web hosting solutions for individuals, small and medium-sized businesses. They say that their primary objective is to provide their customers with internet and server hosting with the highest quality possible. This rings true if we consider that they’ve collected more than a couple of rewards throughout the years.In the Readers' Choice Host Europe was voted as the best service provider of 2019, the second-best in 2020, and a second-best in the cloud hosting category. They were also awarded gold three times at the Hosting & Service Provider Summits and received other awards by HOSTtest.de and from the test portal CHIP for best-in-class accessibility.Host Europe was one among the brands of HEG (Host Europe Group), a web hosting, email, and domain name registrar giant founded in 1997, same as its subsidiary. In December 2016, HEG was acquired by GoDaddy, and its name is slowly being phased out if the news holds true. However, this shouldn’t impact Host Europe in any significant way.Host Europe is headquartered in Cologne and has two “energy-saving and secure” data centers in Cologne and Strasbourg. If you wish to find out more about these two, the “Technology” section on their website provides plenty of information on the matter.The official site of Host Europe looks and feels old-fashioned, although not necessarily in a bad way since it makes finding your way around rather simple. The site is available in German and English language and it features a good-looking blog, which, unfortunately, isn’t translated into English.You can find Host Europe on Facebook (which is in English although the articles linked there are often in German), and Twitter (which is openly exclusive to its German-speaking followers). Host Europe's solutions include shared hosting, WordPress hosting, ecommerce hosting, VPS, reseller hosting, and dedicated server hosting, as well as domain name registration, SSL certificates, backup storage, site security, Microsoft 365 tools, professional email, and a website builder.Although Host Europe's hosting plans are affordable in general, which of them you get to choose from depends on whether you want to pay on a monthly or an annual basis. The price is identical but if you want to commit for one month only you’ll also have to pay a €14.99 ($17.30) one-off setup fee.Regardless of the billing cycle, for €4.99 ($5.75) per month, the “Basic” plan will supply you with one annual domain, SSL, 50GB of storage space, two MySQL databases, one automated mailbox migration (included in the first 30 days), and Kaspersky virus protection. More expensive plans won’t add further features but increase the amount of storage space, the number of databases, and the number of antivirus software solutions.While Host Europe doesn’t offer a money-back guarantee, you can cancel your contract with them within four weeks.As for payment methods, Host Europe accepts all major credit cards, PayPal, and SEPA direct debit. To create an account with Host Europe you’ll have to provide your full name, phone number, email, and physical address, and think up a strong password. Here, you can choose whether you want to be contacted via email, phone, or both. Depending on your choice, you’ll receive an order confirmation via message or email together, containing extremely detailed explanations of the features you can expect to receive, the cancellation policy, and the General Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy.After adding your payment details and making a purchase, you’ll be transferred to Host Europe’s dashboard, which (unfortunately for non-German users) suffers from an incomplete translation to English. To be fair, most important information is fully translated to English, but there are still parts in German, including the FAQ section accessible through the dashboard.Since Host Europe is not the swiftest of providers, you may have to hang around for a while before finding out whether your order was accepted or not. If yes, you’ll still have to provide additional information about your order before you can start using the product you've purchased. As of late, Host Europe provides user-friendly cPanel with its Linux-based products, and Plesk is available with the Windows hosting packages - the two most popular control panels in the industry. As for website building, in addition to a whole variety of CMS options (WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, and so on), ecommerce apps (Magento, Blestan, OpenCart, and more), community building tools (phpBB, Booked, Dada Mail, and so forth) and other useful apps you can easily install via Installatron, you’ll also get a bare-bones version of a beginner-friendly website builder. To get more of everything (sites, webspace per site, templates, email accounts, and so forth) you’ll have to purchase one of the bigger website builder plans as an add-on. After putting Host Europe’s official site to the GTmetrix speed test, we got average results altogether. The time it took for the site to fully load was an amazing 1.3 seconds but all other vital speed measuring metrics (largest contentful paint, total blocking time, and cumulative layout shift) got trapped in the abyss of averageness pulling the final score down to B (74%).When it comes to uptime, Host Europe guarantees an availability of its data centers at 99.95% as a monthly mean, with the exclusion of scheduled (and unscheduled) maintenance windows. This can be translated into 4.5 hours of downtime annually, or about 10 minutes for two weeks.After monitoring the uptime of Host Europe's official site via UptimeRobot for two weeks, we recorded a worrying 55 minutes of downtime which dragged the total uptime to 99.76%, meaning that we should be getting some sweet credit as compensation.If you find yourself in need of a helping hand, you can try reaching Host Europe's team via email, fax, live chat, and, if you’re in a rush, around-the-clock telephone number. The toll-free numbers are available for users from Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, as well as the “order hotline” which is reachable Monday to Friday, from 9 AM to 5 PM. There is even Host Europe's postal address if you feel like writing them an old-fashioned letter and recalling the “old days”. Alternatively, you can browse their “Forms and documents” section for questions related to terms of service, and it is available both in English and German. There is also a well-equipped FAQ section (it’s closer to a knowledge base), but it still isn’t translated into English, which means all users who don’t understand German are left to fend for themselves. Unfortunately, there is no community forum as a final resort before reaching the support personnel. If you want a well-rounded host that will give you more than enough time to decide whether you want to stay with them or part your ways, HostGator may be worth a look. Besides offering an ample 45-day money-back guarantee, it is also geared towards English-speaking users making itself more attractive to an international market than Host Europe.Another US-based alternative to Host Europe is Bluehost, a host that is known for its pocket-friendly pricing and not particularly pocket-friendly price spike after the promotional period. Although with Host Europe there is a one-off setup fee with all monthly plans, at least you won’t have to worry about any sudden price spikes.If you are looking for a simple solution from Germany aimed at personal sites or small businesses, a Berlin-based Strato might be worth a try. Although their scope of hosting solution seems somewhat limited, all their plans support multiple-domain hosting, come with a free domain, a free SSL certificate, plenty of one-click installs, a website builder, and a 30-day “no quibble” money-back guarantee. Unlike Host Europe, Strato doesn’t offer a monthly billing option, although the one you get with Host Europe will set you back with a one-off setup fee.Hostinger is one of the most popular hosts from Europe. It offers its users an access to its servers which are found all around the world including the Americas, Europe, and Asia. Thanks to its 14-day “observation” period you can try out everything for yourselves without a need to worry about your budget. Unfortunately, you will not get such a chance with Host Europe.Host Europe is an award-winning veteran from Germany trusted by over 250.000 customers as we write, and the number keeps on growing. If you can come to terms with data centers in Germany and France (kind of), self-help options being in German only, somewhat sluggish sign-up procedure, and considerable one-off setup fees (with monthly plans), be sure to give Host Europe a chance. If not, HostGator or Bluehost might be a better choice. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!Thank you for signing up to TechRadar.

<title>Atlas VPN review | TechRadar</title>
<content>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more By Mike Williams 12 November 2021 Atlas VPN misses in some areas with its underpowered apps and feeble support site, but there's also plenty to like – it's P2P friendly, with great WireGuard-powered download speeds and no device limits for a very, very low price. Factor in the experience it'll gain after being acquired by NordVPN, and we think Atlas only gets better from.Atlas VPN misses in some areas with its underpowered apps and feeble support site, but there's also plenty to like – it's P2P friendly, with great WireGuard-powered download speeds and no device limits for a very, very low price. Factor in the experience it'll gain after being acquired by NordVPN, and we think Atlas only gets better from.Atlas VPN is a capable VPN provider which offers a decent all-round service for some of the lowest prices around.There's support for the speedy WireGuard protocol, for instance. You get apps for Windows, Mac, iOS and Android, a kill switch to protect you if the VPN drops, and the service allows unlimited simultaneous connections.A SafeSwap feature changes your IP address regularly while you're connected to the same server, maximizing your anonymity.Bonus features include ad and malware blocking, while data breach monitoring alerts you if any of your personal details are found on the dark web.Atlas VPN's network is smaller than many, with 700 servers spread across 27 countries. It'll be enough for many users, though, and P2P is supported everywhere.The really interesting news here came in October 2021, when Nord Security (the company behind NordVPN) announced it had acquired Atlas VPN. That tells you, all on its own, that Atlas isn't just another identikit VPN provider: there's some substance here, something worth buying. And although Atlas VPN will continue as an independent provider, it'll surely benefit in future from Nord Security's resources and experience.Atlas VPN's free no-registration-required plan gives you an easy way to try out the service, though with a couple of significant limits: 400MB per day for data, and three locations only (Amsterdam, New York, Los Angeles).That's not bad, and outperforms the free competition in some areas. Avira's Phantom VPN limits you to 500MB a month, for instance. Avast One's VPN has a generous 5GB a week data allowance, but doesn't support changing locations. ProtonVPN's free offering still wins out for its unlimited data and 12 locations.Opting for a paid plan drops the data and location limits. Prices start at an average $9.99 for monthly billing, and you can pay by card, PayPal and Google Pay. Upgrade to an annual account and the price plummets to just $2.49 a month, while the three-year plan is an amazing $1.39 a month (okay, only for the first term, and it's $3.99 on renewal, but that still looks like a good deal to us).Too good to be true? We'll check that later, but if you sign up and are unhappy, you're protected by a 30-day money-back guarantee.Beware, though: plans automatically renew when you sign up, and there's no way to change this or cancel your account from the control panel. You must email support and ask for help.Atlas VPN has the privacy basics covered with its WireGuard support, AES-256 encryption, kill switch and private DNS system.Unusual extras like rotating IP addresses along with ad and tracker-blocking should bring extra privacy protection.Atlas VPN's own policies aren't as impressive. Access its website for the first time and its cookie disclaimer only has an 'Accept' option, for instance. If you give the company your email address, you're opted in to receive marketing emails unless you specifically say otherwise. And the Blacklight Privacy Inspector found the site used Google Analytics, Facebook and assorted other tracking technologies.(Don't take our or Blacklight's word for it – even Atlas VPN's anti-tracker technology decided it was best to block three trackers on its own website.)Atlas VPN has been through what it calls an independent security audit, but this is just about as limited as we've seen.The exercise only covered the iOS app, for instance. It was a black box review, which means the auditors tested the functionality of the app, but didn't see the source code. And although Atlas VPN quoted some of the results in a blog post, it hasn't published the full report, so there's no way to judge it for ourselves.Okay, this is better than nothing, but only just, and it can't match the best of the competition. TunnelBear has annual audits of its apps, servers and backend infrastructure, for instance, and publishes the results for everyone to see.Atlas VPN claims to have a 'solid no-logs policy', saying 'we do not collect details on our users' activities, DNS queries, or other data that could be linked to our users.'The privacy policy says Atlas VPN's apps collect some device data, though. This includes: 'device type, model, brand name (e.g. Samsung, Apple), OS version, device ID, language, time zone, coarse location (city scale).'It also mentions using 'attribution analytics to track install source and traffic source', and 'advertising IDs to measure performance of our campaigns.'Put it all together and there's nothing to indicate Atlas VPN logs any of your online activities. It does have enough data to build user profiles, though, including details on user devices, when they connect and the amount of data they use. And as Atlas VPN hasn't had its no logging claims audited, there's no independent evidence to tell us if it's living up to its promises.The Windows app is basic, and covers only the VPN fundamentals: a location list of cities, a Connect/Disconnect button, and a handful of settings. (The latter consists of a 'Start on launch' option, an On/Off toggle for the kill switch, and a choice of WireGuard or IKEv2 protocols.)The developer hasn't paid much attention to usability. The location list covers cities, for instance, but they're not grouped by country or sorted in any order we could recognize. ('Germany, Serbia, USA - New Jersey, Hong Kong, Poland, Japan' is a part of the sequence – can you see any pattern?)There's no Favorites system or Recently Used list, either, so changing location is always going to require some scrolling.Our connection attempts failed sometimes with the free Atlas servers, perhaps a sign that they're overloaded. But this wasn't an issue once we upgraded, and connection times were decent at an average 5-6 seconds.Atlas claims its app has malware and ad blocking. There's no sign of this in the app itself, though, and it made no visible difference to us. We saw far better results by installing the free uBlock Origin.Our kill switch tests began with us simulating a dropped VPN. The good news is the kill switch immediately blocked our internet, ensuring we couldn't use the unprotected connection. The bad news – well, where to begin?The app didn't raise an alert when the VPN failed, for instance. It didn't try to reconnect, either. In a real-world situation you might easily waste time checking networks, rebooting your device, or even the router, before you figured out why your internet was down.Usually we could restore normal operations by hitting the Connect button. Sometimes this failed, though, with the app recommending we turned off the kill switch. What, it even blocked its own internet access? Really?We reluctantly agreed to turn the kill switch off, and the app then connected. But when we checked Settings, the kill switch was still marked as on – it hadn't been disabled, after all.Confused? Us too. Overall, the kill switch protected us from dropped connections, and that's what matters most. But the app could do a lot more to keep users informed, and get the VPN up and running again at the maximum possible speed.Desktop VPN apps normally beat their mobile VPN cousins for features, but not here. Atlas VPN's Android app outperforms its Windows offering in several areas.The location list works as expected, for instance, with countries grouped by continent and sorted alphabetically.There's a separate list of Streaming Servers, apparently optimized to reduce buffering, something not included on the desktop build.Settings are essentially the same as Windows, including a kill switch and support for WireGuard and IKEv2 protocols.An Assistant page hosts a tracker blocking feature and the Data Breach Monitor, more options that we couldn't find on Windows. We ran a quick check of these, and found they offered some value. Turning on tracker blocking protected us from some trackers, and entering an email into the Data Breach Monitor listed some of the breaches where our credentials were exposed.Atlas VPN's iOS app also improves on the Windows client with its sensibly sorted location list, tracker blocking and Data Breach Monitor options. It's a little short on features, though, with no WireGuard support or kill switch.Atlas VPN's support website is a little limited, and that's putting it politely. There are very few articles, most don't cover the topics you need, and many of what's left only have a few lines of content.The Troubleshooting section is a great example. We hoped to see some sound general advice on installation problems, issues with app features or download speeds. Instead, we found only four articles on very specific issues, such as 'How to fix error 13801 on Windows?' and 'What if my PC does not support Atlas VPN 64-bit?'(And if you're expecting any depth with the help provided, prepare for disappointment. This is the entire and unedited answer to that last question: 'No need to worry if your Windows device does not support Atlas VPN 64-bit: you can download the 32-bit version here.')Atlas VPN has no live chat support, but you can contact the company via email. We sent a message with a couple of simple product questions. Does the Windows app have tracker blocking? And which, if any of the apps block malicious websites or ads, as none of them mention it anywhere?A reply arrived just over two hours later, not bad for a response time.The message read: 'The mentioned features are currently being tested, therefore they are not available on all platforms. They should be rolled out to other OS'es soon, however, we are unable to provide an exact ETA as it may be misleading.'As Atlas VPN couldn't tell us which apps support malicious website or ad blocking, we'll assume the feature isn't available yet. That might have changed by the time you read this, but if it's a priority for you, ask the company before you sign up.Atlas VPN hadn't always impressed us so far, but it got off to a great unblocking start by getting us into BBC iPlayer.Accessing US Amazon was more difficult than usual, as it asked us to complete a CAPTCHA first. IP reputation service IPQualityScore revealed that our Atlas server IP address had a fraud rating of 100, with recent abuse reported. That's not anything directly to do with Atlas VPN, but it suggests the free plan and low prices might make the company especially appealing to hackers. That makes for more blacklisted IPs, and could mean more CAPTCHAS and other security hassles for you.Once we'd accessed US Amazon Prime, though, Atlas allowed us to stream content right away. We moved on to Disney Plus and were able to access that site, too.US Netflix is the jewel in the unblocking crown, though, and it was out of Atlas VPN's reach. We weren't able to view content from any of Atlas VPN's US servers.We measure VPN performance by running several benchmarking services – SpeedTest's website and command line app, SpeedOf.me, nPerf – from both a UK data center and a US residential location. We run each benchmark five times using WireGuard and OpenVPN (where available), run them a second time several hours later (that's a minimum of 120 tests), then analyze the data to see what's going on.Atlas VPN doesn't support OpenVPN, but its IKEv2 speeds were reasonable at a mid-range 260-320Mpps in the US, 170-210Mbps in the UK.Switching to WireGuard made a big difference, though, with speeds jumping to 590-600Mbps in the UK, and 650-800Mbps in the US. That's not quite a performance leader – NordVPN peaked at 880Mbps, IPVanish at 900Mbps – but it beat names like Windscribe (430-480Mbps), StrongVPN (450Mbps) and Surfshark (450-475Mbps).Atlas VPN may not have the best network, or apps, or support site – for those, you'd have to go for a more established provider like ExpressVPN. But now it's owned by Nord Security, we'd expect to see some improvements. And even right now, Atlas VPN's speeds are good, it unblocks more sites than many, and the three-year plan is as cheap as you'll see anywhere.Mike began his career as a lead software developer in the engineering world, where his creations were used by big-name companies from Rolls Royce to British Nuclear Fuels and British Aerospace.

<title>Calendar.com review | TechRadar</title>
<content>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more By Stefan Ionescu 11 November 2021 Calendar.com is a long-standing name on the market for calendar apps, and its developers have put a lot of effort into making it a good, well-rounded solution. The interface is very light on the eyes and works smoothly, and the app itself offers lots of different features aimed at users with specific needs. It comes in several pricing tiers – including a free one – that allow users to pick the version that best matches their individual preferences. Calendar.com is a long-standing name on the market for calendar apps, and its developers have put a lot of effort into making it a good, well-rounded solution. The interface is very light on the eyes and works smoothly, and the app itself offers lots of different features aimed at users with specific needs. It comes in several pricing tiers – including a free one – that allow users to pick the version that best matches their individual preferences. If you’ve spent some time looking for a good calendar app, you’ve probably noticed that the market tends to be divided into two main categories. On one hand, we have apps aimed at individual users, offering a small but solid set of features that fit most needs. On the other hand, there are also the more advanced, professional calendar apps that offer lots of features and are designed to work best in large organizations.Calendar.com is a little bit of both, with features that can make it an attractive choice for regular home users, while also offering a competent professional package suitable for organizations of different sizes. The app is offered on multiple platforms as well, making it one of the most versatile offers on the market at the moment. Users can easily check out the free version and then upgrade to one of the premium tiers, and it doesn’t take long to set it up on different devices.There are three plans available – Free, Standard ($6/month), and Pro ($8/month). The free plan comes with pretty much everything one might need for regular daily use, and doesn’t lock any critical features behind a paywall, unlike some competing apps. Users on this tier can connect to one calendar on an external platform, and will have one basic workspace to use. It’s worth noting that up to five members can be added to a single workspace, even on a free tier, which makes the app better for collaboration for those who don’t want to pay for a premium solution.The two premium tiers add a variety of extra features aimed primarily at users in organizations. This includes the ability to sync more calendars under a single account, unlimited workspace members, meetings with 25 and even 50 guests, and analytics that can help you gain a deeper understanding of your scheduling habits. Calendar.com comes with all standard features you would expect to find in a modern calendar app. You can view your schedule in different modes – day/week/month/year, and can easily share your calendar with other users, including those on Google services. Free users can set up meetings with up to 5 attendants, and the app offers advanced scheduling options to help you find the best available timeslot.Some of the features offered by Calendar.com can’t be found in other similar apps, or at least not often – such as the ability to embed calendars in web pages, and the native Zapier integration. Zoom integration is available as well, though only on the premium tiers. For most individual users, this shouldn’t matter much, but for those planning to use Calendar.com in an organization, subscribing to one of the premium tiers will be a good idea. The interface of Calendar.com doesn’t shine with anything unusual, but it gets the job done more or less fine. The app leans towards a more minimalistic design, hiding elements that are not used frequently and focusing on the major parts of the interface. That said, you should find it very easy to dig up any feature you might need, and it doesn’t take long to get used to the way the interface is organized.The app does tend to flow a bit better with a premium subscription, mainly because it unlocks its full range of features. The free tier still has its benefits though – especially for those looking for simplicity and a clean design. Some users might find the additional features in the premium tiers confusing, since many of them are aimed at organizations and similar use cases. Give the free version a try before deciding to upgrade to a premium plan, as it might work just fine for your specific needs.The company provides standard email support on top of their help knowledge base, and they additionally offer some special options to premium subscribers. If you’re on the Standard or Pro tier, you can get in touch with support representatives over the phone, and your inquiries will be prioritized. Free users will still get support, but in a more limited capacity. Most of the problems you may encounter during your use of the app should already be covered in the knowledgebase in any case.Calendar.com manages to stand out with its set of features and pricing plans. The app faces direct competition from Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, and other popular solutions like Fantastical. It still has a dedicated user base, and some have been with it for many years at this point. Choosing between Calendar.com and some of its popular competitors is mostly about personal choice with regards to things like interface organization and pricing, and the app is definitely worth checking out if you’re currently comparing the different options on the market.The app does a great job on all fronts, and can be equally useful to individuals as well as large organizations. It takes some time to get used to how it works, but after that, everything is quite easy. The strong support it receives from its developers is nothing but a huge plus as well, so if you’re looking for a good calendar app that covers all important bases at a reasonable price, look no further.We've also featured the best calendar apps and best time management appsStefan has always been a lover of tech.

<title>FastVPN review | TechRadar</title>
<content>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more By Mike Williams 12 November 2021 Seriously cheap for the first year, but you can see why: the desktop apps are unreliable, and there are very features. For unblocking Netflix and basic tasks only.Seriously cheap for the first year, but you can see why: the desktop apps are unreliable, and there are very features. For unblocking Netflix and basic tasks only.FastVPN is a simple VPN owned by Namecheap, the popular domain registrar and web hosting service.If you're wondering why you should trust a domain registrar to run your VPN, good question. No need to worry, though; it's using servers run by an arm of StackPath, which has also provided the network for major VPN brands such as IPVanish and StrongVPN.Whoever owns the network, it's a decent size, with 1,000+ P2P-friendly servers spread across 75+ locations worldwide. Apps are available for Windows, Mac, iOS and Android; tutorials show how to set up the service on Linux and various routers, and, unusually, there are no annoying limits on the number of devices you can connect at one time.The feature list is basic, though, covering the bare essentials only. You get OpenVPN and IKEv2 protocol support (no WireGuard), secure DNS to reduce the chance of DNS leaks, a kill switch to block internet access if the VPN drops, and that's about it.FastVPN's starting prices are some of the lowest around, thanks to big discounts off your first term.Sign up for the monthly plan, for instance, and you'll pay nothing at all for the first month, effectively a 30-day free trial, rising to a still-excellent $5.88 on renewal.The annual plan is just $1 a month for year one, rising to $2.88 on renewal. There are no longer-term plans (the old three-year option has disappeared.)These are very low first-term prices (and they're pretty good on renewal, too). Private Internet Access is one of our go-to VPNs for value, but with monthly plans at $9.95, dropping to $3.33 paid annually, it's still no match for FastVPN.If you are tempted, you're able to by card or PayPal, and there's a 30-day money-back guarantee to protect you if it all goes wrong.The FastVPN website comments briefly on logging, saying you'll "keep your browsing activities to yourself with our strict no-log policy" and that the service "won’t track, collect, or share any of your logs". We searched the website for something more detailed, without any luck. The only extra information we found came from the Windows VPN app installer, which warned that it collected "aggregated anonymous app usage data, including your device and OS version so we can troubleshoot and improve our app", but "that's it", and that there's "no tracking of your personal identifiable information".We'd like a little more substance than that, and ideally a security or no-logging audit, but that doesn't seem likely to happen any time soon. FastVPN is targeted at the average consumer who wants something easy to use which 'just works', and not the kind of user who cares about session logging or whether it uses AES-256-CBC or GCM.FastVPN's Windows app opens with a default 'Best Available' server choice, and a 'Connect VPN' button. The client displays the name of your current network, too, a handy way to be sure you're connecting to the official coffee shop Wi-Fi, and not some shady open network nearby.A location picker to the left gives a list of countries (some with city-level choices), server load and ping time information (you can sort by those, too), simple Favorites system to easily group your most commonly used locations.Although this looked good in theory, real-world performance was poor. OpenVPN connections took up to 40 seconds, three to four times faster than we usually see, and IKEv2 connections were also poor at 18-20 seconds.That was just the start. Occasionally, after connecting, we found we couldn't access any websites. Sometimes the VPN dropped, complaining of various internal errors or that there was 'no network detected.' It didn't help that some of these error messages were layered on top of normal status information, making them difficult to read. Not a huge issue, but it all helps to create a poor impression of the app. We expect better from a big company such as Namecheap.Settings are relatively limited: auto-start options, a choice of protocol (IKEv2, OpenVPN TCP/ UDP, and a Scramble option to help bypass VPN blocking), and a kill switch to block internet access if the VPN drops.The app handled unexpected disconnects very well. We forcibly closed our IKEv2 connection, the app noticed, displayed a notification and reconnected at once. So, we closed the connection again, then kept closing it, as fast we could, interrupting every reconnect attempt. That's a level of stress testing which goes way beyond what you're likely to see in real life, but the app just waited until we'd finished, then reconnected as before.The kill switch generally worked well, too. Whatever we did to IKEv2 or OpenVPN connections, the app raised an alert, wasn't especially troubled by our extreme testing methods and reconnected as soon as it could, without ever leaving us unprotected. FastVPN's Android VPN app looks and feels very similar to the Windows edition: big green Connect button, by default you're connected to the nearest server, but you can choose something else from a searchable list of locations.We noticed small usability issues. The desktop app hides city locations by default, and they're only visible if you expand a specific country. The mobile app displays city and country names in the same list, so there's much more scrolling (and the cities aren't always displayed in alphabetical order, either.) Settings are basic, too, with protocol options reduced to OpenVPN UDP or TCP (no IKEv2, this time).FastVPN's iOS app is very similar, but does add one very useful feature. An Always On option enables automatically connecting to the VPN whenever you access untrusted networks, while also ignoring networks you know are safe (home, work, etc).These apps aren't bad, and they didn't have the technical issues we saw on the desktop. But they're also short on features, and can't begin to compete with the best VPNs.FastVPN doesn't make any specific claims about its website-unblocking abilities, but generally suggests it can help you 'securely unblock sites and content.'This certainly worked as a BBC iPlayer VPN, where FastVPN got us access with the first location we tried.The service scored an even big victory when it unblocked US Netflix, a task which defeats many big VPN names.But FastVPN couldn't keep up that level of success, and it failed with Amazon Prime Video and Disney+.That's not a bad result, but we've seen some providers do much better. CyberGhost, ExpressVPN, Hide.me, Private Internet Access, ProtonVPN and Surfshark all unblocked everything in their latest reviews.We measured FastVPN speeds from a UK data center with excellent connectivity and a 1Gbps connection, giving us room to see exactly what the service could do.FastVPN turned out to be not so fast after all, with both OpenVPN and IKEv2 speeds reaching a modest 250Mbps. That's better than some - NordVPN and IPVanish didn't reach 200Mbps with OpenVPN - but a long way behind OpenVPN leaders such as HideMyAss! (340-350Mbps), Hide.me (390Mbps) and ProtonVPN (400-460Mbps.)There's another problem. OpenVPN is the fastest protocol FastVPN supports, but most providers give you much more capable options. IPVanish's WireGuard connections hit 750-900Mbps in recent reviews, for instance, while NordVPN's NordLynx was a close match at 760-880Mbps.So despite the name, there's no chance this service will appear in our list of the truly fastest VPNs. But although FastVPN trails far behind in the speed stakes, it's also far from the worst we've seen, and the service should handle most browsing or streaming tasks with ease.FastVPN's ultra-low starter prices caught our eye, but the Windows app was unreliable and there are very few features. Could work as a cheap VPN for unblocking Netflix and other basic tasks, but this isn't the service for experienced or demanding users. Assuming you want something better, we'd suggest going for our #1 rated ExpressVPN or, to save on costs, the also brilliant Surfshark.Mike began his career as a lead software developer in the engineering world, where his creations were used by big-name companies from Rolls Royce to British Nuclear Fuels and British Aerospace.

<title>Zoho Recruit review | TechRadar</title>
<content>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more By Mike Jennings 12 November 2021 Zoho Recruit offers excellent features that are easy to use though this recruitment tool can be expensive for smaller businesses.Zoho Recruit offers excellent features that are easy to use though this recruitment tool can be expensive for smaller businesses.Zoho Recruit is one of the biggest Applicant Tracking System (ATS) services in the world, so it’s going to be right at the top of most people’s lists if they need some help with their hunt for top-quality staff.There’s plenty going for Zoho Recruit, including a free option and a broad range of features. Still, we’ve also got questions about some of the firm’s support options and integration abilities.Zoho Recruit has a broad range of features that are divided into three kinds of product – one for companies, another for recruitment agencies and a third for people who need to hire temporary staff.The Corporate HR product allows you to post job openings to hundreds of different mainstream and niche job boards, and you can boost job listings on social networks. You can also search through resumes with AI-powered modules that will find candidates on your behalf. You can set up a dedicated resume inbox and invite recruiters to submit potential candidates through a portal with your own branding. You can also establish an employee referral portal to allow your existing staff to give recommendations.Zoho’s AI features are robust and impressive. Applicants can be graded in advance based on your preferred traits and requirements, and advanced searches help narrow down the candidate pool.You can use Zoho’s background screening module to run background checks so you can adhere to your preferred hiring practices, and you can ask candidates to complete pre-screening assessments to help eliminate unsuitable people and streamline the process.HR staff and candidates can access dedicated portals to track the status of applications, and Zoho allows you to track recruitment stats and analyze data. Thanks to a customized series of alerts, rules, and actions, corporate HR staff can also automate much of the recruitment process. Impressively, Zoho’s entire experience can be customized, from the branding and aesthetic of the software to custom tabs and layout options.Switch over to Zoho’s agency module, and you get the same features alongside options to have powerful client portals that allow agency clients to create vacancies easily, send feedback and invite people to interview. And if you use Zoho’s temporary staff product, you’ll receive help from straightforward and powerful scheduling and timesheet tools alongside electronic signatures and invoicing to speed up laborious parts of the process. Temporary workers can also access their own portal to mark their availability and view their workloads.Zoho does have good features, but some things are missing here too. Zoho Recruit has integrations with Outlook, LinkedIn, Google Suite, and a selection of other products and services, but you’ll find more integration ability elsewhere.This service doesn’t have as many behavioral, skill, and cognitive testing options as some other recruitment services, either. You only get 24/7 support if you pay extra, too – standard plans only have support five days of the week.Zoho’s broader company offers a full range of HR products, which is excellent if you want to pick and choose features or opt for a more comprehensive HR solution. Sadly, though, that means you don’t get onboarding unless you pay more.Zoho’s standard Corporate HR package costs $25 per month if you buy annually, and you get the service’s core features alongside candidate sourcing, resume management, tracking, and Google, Zoho, and Microsoft Outlook integrations. If you buy the $50 per month Enterprise product, you get AI-powered candidate matching, improvement portal management, and advanced customization. On top of that, you’ll need to pay extra for hiring manager and vendor portal licenses.Recruitment agencies can pay for $25, $50, and $75 tiers, with the two latter options adding extra features. That $50 choice adds AI matching, advanced analytics, better security control, portal management, and candidate assessment options. The top-tier service adds more customization and portal options.The temporary employee package has a simple, single price of $59 a month, although you’ll have to pay more if you want to hire more than 25 employees.Zoho Recruit’s three products also have free tiers that give you candidate management, interview scheduling, and simple resume search options alongside other basic features.

<title>iTop VPN | TechRadar</title>
<content>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more By Mike Williams 12 November 2021 iTop VPN's generous 700MB/day (21GB/month) free plan might be worth a look for simple, non-privacy-critical tasks, but the service has too many fundamental issues to justify handing over your cash.iTop VPN's generous 700MB/day (21GB/month) free plan might be worth a look for simple, non-privacy-critical tasks, but the service has too many fundamental issues to justify handing over your cash.iTop VPN is a free VPN service with an affordable paid plan and one or two unusual privacy extras.The free plan gives you 700MB of data per day (21GB per month), and a choice of 16 locations (including the US and UK), easily beating most of the competition.Paying for a subscription gets you access to 100+ locations and 1,800+ streaming and gaming-optimized servers. (P2P is supported, too, though only on a handful of specialist servers.)A longer-than-usual list of bonus features include split tunneling, along with ad, tracker and malware blocking, browser history cleaning, and a Security Reinforce tool checks your device privacy settings and warns of any problems.iTop VPN has apps for Windows, Mac (a recent addition), Android and iOS, and support for connecting up to five devices simultaneously.This VPN's monthly plan is priced at $11.99, not the highest we've seen, but more expensive than most.Paying six months upfront cuts the cost to $6.99 a month, but that's still above average. You're paying iTop $41.94 to get your six months of cover, for instance, but Private Internet Access only asks $39.95 for a full year ($3.33 a month).iTop isn't done yet, though. Opt for its annual plan and you'll get an extra year thrown in, giving you two year's protection for $2.31 a month. A handful of providers are even cheaper – Private Internet Access has a three-year plan for $2.19 a month, Ivacy and PrivadoVPN go even lower – but that still looks like a real bargain.iTop supports payments via card, PayPal and bank transfers. It's good to see that you can turn off auto-renewal when you purchase the service, too, ensuring you won't accidentally pay for a second term that you don't want.Even better, if you're unhappy, a 15-day 'no questions asked' money-back guarantee (7 days for monthly-billed plans) means you're able to get your first payment back, too.Most VPNs protect your privacy by using secure VPN protocols such as WireGuard and OpenVPN. This doesn't guarantee you'll be safe – a provider can easily make mistakes in how they're set up – but they're open source, so anyone can see how they work or check the code for problems.However, iTop uses a custom scheme of its own. The Windows app appears to make a fast proxy connection to the VPN server, then uses an open source package called WinDivert to direct your traffic through the tunnel, apparently encrypting it with iTop's own protocol.Maybe this is secure, maybe it's not, but the company doesn't provide enough information to judge. You can't check the encryption it uses, for instance.We noticed a separate privacy issue on the iTop VPN website. Its SSL certificate wasn't properly configured, and this allowed us to access areas of the site, including the Login page, using an unencrypted HTTP connection. Unless you're using the VPN, that risks exposing your credentials to snoopers.iTop scores another privacy thumbs-down for its order form, where it insisted we entered our full name, city and post or ZIP code. A tooltip tried to justify this by saying that the details 'allow us to contact you if there are any issues with your order.' Uh, isn't that what our email address is for?iTop VPN claims to have a no logging policy, and the privacy policy spells out what this means.The company does its best to sound reassuring, telling users: 'We do not log your activity while you are utilizing the Services, including your browsing history, the bandwidth you used, or how long you connected to VPN servers. We do not store your original IP address or the server IP address that you connect to.'Sounds good, but we already know this can't be entirely true. iTop VPN limits its free plan to 700MB a day, so to make this work it must log the bandwidth you use and associate it with a device ID.Scroll down the page and you'll find a 'What information we collect' section, which could also include a lot of data: '...operating system, device ID, Internet protocol addresses, browser type, browser language, referring/exit pages, clickstream data of our websites and our products or services, and the pages or features of our software or services accessed by you and the time spent there.'Some of that looks like it's referring to the website, not iTop's apps, but the fact that we're left to guess is a problem. A privacy policy should be clear and precise, not leave us with more questions than it answers.Whatever you think of iTop VPN's claims, the real problem here is the company hasn't had them confirmed by any kind of security or logging audit. We're left to take iTop on trust, and hope the firm is delivering what it promises.iTop VPN's apps look good and are stuffed with features, but also score poorly on many of the usability fundamentals.Hitting a big red Connect button should by default automatically connect you to the nearest server, for instance. But even though we were testing from the UK, the free app regularly connected us to Japan, and the paid plan sometimes chose Germany.An 'All Servers' list enables switching to another location, but this also isn't as easy as it should be. For example, the countries aren't sorted by name, continent, distance or any other order we could recognize (there are sequences like Korea, Russia, UK, Italy, Singapore and so on). And there's no Favorites system or Recently Used lists to help out.The app is missing some usability shortcuts we commonly see elsewhere. You can't double click a location name to connect, for instance – you must click a location's Connect button, instead. When the app does connect (or disconnect), there's no notification to alert you, so you won't know whether you're protected unless you keep an eye on the app interface.On the plus side, you get separate Streaming, Social and Gaming lists where you can view locations optimized for specific platforms (PUBG, Warzone, Netflix, Disney Plus, Amazon Prime, iPlayer, Hulu and more).Too much scrolling? The Quick Access pane lists 17 common reasons for using a VPN: Browse Privacy, Hide Location, Watch Netflix, Play PUBG, Unblock WhatsApp (or Telegram, Facebook, Twitter etc), and more. If you're looking to unblock Netflix, there's no need to scan down a lengthy list of servers and try to guess which is best: just tap 'Watch Netflix' and the app automatically chooses a location for you.These work well, and we like the flexibility. But we'd prefer iTop VPN to sort out some of the interface basics before it layers on any more extras.iTop VPN's Mac app mostly looks like the Windows build, but with a few very noticeable changes.There's no Downloading section, for instance – the P2P locations are in the 'All Servers' lists. The Quick Tasks section doesn't have a Play PUBG tile. There's no kill switch and no Settings menu (the Protocols list is now on the main screen). If you regularly use both the Windows and Mac apps, the differences could be a little confusing.The iOS app is all about simplicity, with no Settings menu, no kill switch, no P2P, no HTTPS protocol option, and absolutely no bonus privacy tools. Instead, you just get the location lists, a big Connect button and a choice of TCP/UDP protocols.There's good news in one iOS area. Cities are grouped into countries, making for a shorter and better-organized list. But it's still not sorted alphabetically (and to make it worse, the iOS app uses a different order to the Windows build).The Android app is essentially the iOS version with added split tunneling, and yet another sort order for the servers list. Not a big deal unless you're using iTop VPN on several platforms – only then will you need to remember where your favorite locations appear on each device.iTop VPN supports a kill switch to stop internet traffic if the VPN drops unexpectedly. We found the Windows app was mostly successful, but had some flaws. When we forcibly crashed the app, for instance, our VPN connection dropped, the kill switch didn't kick in, and our traffic was unprotected. And as the app doesn't raise any notifications, an affected user is unlikely to realize they're at risk in such a scenario.Split tunneling support allows you to decide which apps use the tunnel, and which don't. It's handy if you only need the VPN to unblock a couple of websites, say, as other apps can use your normal (and faster) connection. This worked well for us, directing only browsers through the VPN by default, but making it easy to add other apps as required.A DNS Protection feature claims to protect your DNS settings from modification by malware. You can also set your DNS to one of several public DNS providers, simply by choosing them from a list: Google, OpenDNS, Verizon, Comodo and DNS Advantage.The app has a handful of settings. You're able to launch it when Windows starts, optionally connect, and choose one of three protocol options: UDP, TCP and HTTPS. As iTop VPN doesn't use any standard VPN protocol, it's not completely clear what the effects of these settings might be, and the descriptions don't help much. (Choosing TCP apparently gets you 'high level privacy', for instance, while opting for UDP means faster speeds but 'more data usage for special occasions.')iTop VPN is also missing some of the more advanced settings we see with other apps. It won't automatically connect when you access insecure Wi-Fi, for example. There are no leak protection options, and we saw no way to control notifications.iTop VPN has some privacy and security extras that we've not seen with other VPNs.A Security Reinforce module scanned our PC for weak or non-standard security settings, then suggested appropriate changes. You'll need some technical knowledge to understand its report, but the advice looks good to us, and is likely to improve your system security.The Browser Privacy feature can check and clear your browsing tracks in Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Opera and even Internet Explorer.These tools aren't the best we've seen, and they're maybe not all suitable for a VPN. Most providers use their own DNS servers rather than OpenVPN or Google, for instance, as that ensures no one else gets to see the sites you visit.But there's also more power here than we expected. DNS Protection isn't something iTop VPN threw together in an afternoon, for instance – it's an IObit feature taken direct from IObit Malware Fighter. Put it all together and the extras could have some value for more experienced users. (Although, as with the main app interface, we'd be happier if the developer sorted out the core features before starting with piling on the extras.)iTop VPN apps have specialist locations for unblocking many platforms, making them far easier to use than many competitors. If you're looking to unblock a supported platform in the US, say, you don't have to start choosing US locations until you find one that works: just choose a service from the list and you're ready to go.We tried this with BBC iPlayer, often a tricky site to unblock, but iTop VPN got us access right away.iTop VPN has Disney Plus locations in New York and Los Angeles. They both worked for us.There are streaming locations for Amazon Prime in the US and UK, but we weren't so lucky with these. Amazon spotted what we were doing, displayed its 'your device is connected to the internet using a VPN or proxy service' and demanded we 'disable it and try again.'It was the same disappointing story with Netflix: iTop VPN has a couple of specialist Netflix servers (US and Korea) but neither worked for us.Getting us into two of our four test sites isn't bad, but other providers do much better. CyberGhost, ExpressVPN, Hide.me, Hola, PrivadoVPN, Private Internet Access, ProtonVPN and Surfshark all unblocked every one of our test platforms in recent reviews.We measured iTop VPN speeds from US and UK locations with a 1Gbps connection in both cases, using several performance testing sites and services (SpeedTest's website and command line app, nPerf, SpeedOfme and more). We checked the download speeds at least five times from each site, and then we repeated all the tests in an evening session.UK download speeds were very ordinary at 180-190Mbps, but US performance was much better, with peak median speeds of around 360-400Mps, even reaching 900Mbps at one point. We're skeptical about that peak score, as it only happened in a single session out of the 20 we ran in the US, and none of the others got near even half that speed. We think the 360-400Mbps figure is more representative of what you're likely to see.That's not a bad result, and it's a close match with the OpenVPN performance we see from the likes of HideMyAss! (270-410Mbps) and TunnelBear (330-350Mbps).iTop's results lag well behind many other VPNs, though, especially when they're using WireGuard and faster protocols (providers such as CyberGhost, IPVanish and NordVPN regularly hit 750-900Mbps).There's another issue, too. That 330-350Mbps we saw from TunnelBear was using a standard OpenVPN connection with a very well-understood level of encryption and security. But iTop VPN uses the company's own custom protocol, which means we can't be sure these figures are a fair comparison. If iTop VPN is using more basic encryption, for instance, that might give it a big performance advantage, but at the cost of some security.iTop VPN has a stack of powerful extras, but it misses on a lot of the VPN fundamentals: there is no OpenVPN or WireGuard, limited unblocking, a flawed kill switch, plus various privacy issues. Its 700MB per day (21GB a month) free plan might be worth considering, but we wouldn't use it for anything privacy-critical.Mike began his career as a lead software developer in the engineering world, where his creations were used by big-name companies from Rolls Royce to British Nuclear Fuels and British Aerospace.

<title>Workable review | TechRadar</title>
<content>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more By Mike Jennings 12 November 2021 While Workable provides plenty of features for recruitment, many rivals go a bit further with their respective offerings.While Workable provides plenty of features for recruitment, many rivals go a bit further with their respective offerings.Workable is a dedicated recruitment platform and Applicant Tracking System and it doesn’t tie into a wider suite of HR products, so it’s got a focused and well-designed range of features.It’s not the cheapest recruitment solution around, though, so it’s going to have to impress if businesses are going to find room for Workable in their budgets.Workable’s features are divided into three strands – the first sources and attracts candidates, the second handles evaluation and interviews, and the third tackles hiring.Workable has one-click job posting to more than 200 job boards, and it integrates with your company’s social media channels so you can advertise your own vacancies. You can also use Workable’s own drag-and-drop system to build your corporate careers page, and job applications from various sources are collated into a single pipeline for easier management.Lots of the processes can be automated, too. Workable’s AI systems supply a list of up to 50 potential candidates when you post a new job – you don’t even have to wait for the resumes to roll in. This service can automatically create social adverts for your positions, and Workable’s Chrome extension can deliver in-depth candidate information based on their social media profiles.Recruiters can also use Workable’s powerful Boolean search options to find suitable candidates. Workable has internal application options and an employee referral platform that can include unique sharing links and referral rewards.Switch over to the evaluation and interview module, and you’ll find more helpful features. You can use more than 700 job description templates that are SEO-optimized, and you can customize your hiring pipeline for consistency and familiarity.The service supports two-way syncing with Gmail and Outlook accounts to help recruiters and candidates stay on the same page, and Workable has an app to allow staff to manage recruitment on the move. Elsewhere, you’ll find collaborative tools that can be used by your whole HR team and in-built support for video interviews, and you can automate candidate communication. Anonymized candidate screening enables more inclusive hiring, and you can assess candidates using skillset, personality, and cognitive ability tests – and then see all the data so you can make informed hiring decisions.Further automation streamlines the hiring process, and you can use a central workflow and timeline to keep staff abreast of hiring processes and budgets. Workable has built-in offer letters and electronic signatures, and Workable also supports national, international, and local regulations to help your company be fully compliant.Workable also integrates with software from Microsoft, Google, Facebook, and LinkedIn, and can also be used with HR tools from Glassdoor, Bamboo, and Indeed. Ultimately, there are dozens of third-party integrations here for products that handle video interviews, assessments, referrals, sourcing, and every other part of the recruitment process.Workable does have a broad range of features, but large companies may want more customization and abilities from an HR product that handles more than just the recruitment process. Workable also misses out on automated reference checking, and it doesn’t have any onboarding options beyond the ability to offer jobs to candidates.Workable’s software is divided into four different products. The Paygo option costs $99 per job posted per month, and it has Workable’s essential features but few of the advanced options – it’s billed as a self-service choice for companies that only hire occasionally.The Core, Growth, and Premier options supply added functionality – the Core option builds on the PayGo service, the Growth tier adds automation options and extra features alongside a dedicated account manager, and the Premier option unlocks every feature alongside bespoke onboarding for the service in your business.Workable doesn’t list the pricing for those three products, though. You’ll have to get in touch with the company and work out costs based on your company’s size and needs.Workable is a straightforward recruitment tool with a good range of features that deliver a well-balanced approach across the entire recruitment process.It’s particularly useful for small and medium-sized businesses who need recruitment software to integrate with other HR services they may use. Still, larger companies with their own HR staff or full-service third-party options may not find this dedicated product necessary.We've also featured the best recruitment platforms, best HR software and best background check servicesSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!Thank you for signing up to TechRadar.

<title>Host Europe web hosting review | TechRadar</title>
<content>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more By Mike Williams , Mirza Bahic 12 November 2021 Host Europe is a strong, stable, and feature-packed web hosting provider geared towards German-speaking customers. If you fall into this category, don’t hesitate to give them a chance.Host Europe is a strong, stable, and feature-packed web hosting provider geared towards German-speaking customers. If you fall into this category, don’t hesitate to give them a chance.Established in 1997 in Germany, Host Europe has become and remained rather successful since, continuing to offer web hosting solutions for individuals, small and medium-sized businesses. They say that their primary objective is to provide their customers with internet and server hosting with the highest quality possible. This rings true if we consider that they’ve collected more than a couple of rewards throughout the years.In the Readers' Choice Host Europe was voted as the best service provider of 2019, the second-best in 2020, and a second-best in the cloud hosting category. They were also awarded gold three times at the Hosting & Service Provider Summits and received other awards by HOSTtest.de and from the test portal CHIP for best-in-class accessibility.Host Europe was one among the brands of HEG (Host Europe Group), a web hosting, email, and domain name registrar giant founded in 1997, same as its subsidiary. In December 2016, HEG was acquired by GoDaddy, and its name is slowly being phased out if the news holds true. However, this shouldn’t impact Host Europe in any significant way.Host Europe is headquartered in Cologne and has two “energy-saving and secure” data centers in Cologne and Strasbourg. If you wish to find out more about these two, the “Technology” section on their website provides plenty of information on the matter.The official site of Host Europe looks and feels old-fashioned, although not necessarily in a bad way since it makes finding your way around rather simple. The site is available in German and English language and it features a good-looking blog, which, unfortunately, isn’t translated into English.You can find Host Europe on Facebook (which is in English although the articles linked there are often in German), and Twitter (which is openly exclusive to its German-speaking followers). Host Europe's solutions include shared hosting, WordPress hosting, ecommerce hosting, VPS, reseller hosting, and dedicated server hosting, as well as domain name registration, SSL certificates, backup storage, site security, Microsoft 365 tools, professional email, and a website builder.Although Host Europe's hosting plans are affordable in general, which of them you get to choose from depends on whether you want to pay on a monthly or an annual basis. The price is identical but if you want to commit for one month only you’ll also have to pay a €14.99 ($17.30) one-off setup fee.Regardless of the billing cycle, for €4.99 ($5.75) per month, the “Basic” plan will supply you with one annual domain, SSL, 50GB of storage space, two MySQL databases, one automated mailbox migration (included in the first 30 days), and Kaspersky virus protection. More expensive plans won’t add further features but increase the amount of storage space, the number of databases, and the number of antivirus software solutions.While Host Europe doesn’t offer a money-back guarantee, you can cancel your contract with them within four weeks.As for payment methods, Host Europe accepts all major credit cards, PayPal, and SEPA direct debit. To create an account with Host Europe you’ll have to provide your full name, phone number, email, and physical address, and think up a strong password. Here, you can choose whether you want to be contacted via email, phone, or both. Depending on your choice, you’ll receive an order confirmation via message or email together, containing extremely detailed explanations of the features you can expect to receive, the cancellation policy, and the General Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy.After adding your payment details and making a purchase, you’ll be transferred to Host Europe’s dashboard, which (unfortunately for non-German users) suffers from an incomplete translation to English. To be fair, most important information is fully translated to English, but there are still parts in German, including the FAQ section accessible through the dashboard.Since Host Europe is not the swiftest of providers, you may have to hang around for a while before finding out whether your order was accepted or not. If yes, you’ll still have to provide additional information about your order before you can start using the product you've purchased. As of late, Host Europe provides user-friendly cPanel with its Linux-based products, and Plesk is available with the Windows hosting packages - the two most popular control panels in the industry. As for website building, in addition to a whole variety of CMS options (WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, and so on), ecommerce apps (Magento, Blestan, OpenCart, and more), community building tools (phpBB, Booked, Dada Mail, and so forth) and other useful apps you can easily install via Installatron, you’ll also get a bare-bones version of a beginner-friendly website builder. To get more of everything (sites, webspace per site, templates, email accounts, and so forth) you’ll have to purchase one of the bigger website builder plans as an add-on. After putting Host Europe’s official site to the GTmetrix speed test, we got average results altogether. The time it took for the site to fully load was an amazing 1.3 seconds but all other vital speed measuring metrics (largest contentful paint, total blocking time, and cumulative layout shift) got trapped in the abyss of averageness pulling the final score down to B (74%).When it comes to uptime, Host Europe guarantees an availability of its data centers at 99.95% as a monthly mean, with the exclusion of scheduled (and unscheduled) maintenance windows. This can be translated into 4.5 hours of downtime annually, or about 10 minutes for two weeks.After monitoring the uptime of Host Europe's official site via UptimeRobot for two weeks, we recorded a worrying 55 minutes of downtime which dragged the total uptime to 99.76%, meaning that we should be getting some sweet credit as compensation.If you find yourself in need of a helping hand, you can try reaching Host Europe's team via email, fax, live chat, and, if you’re in a rush, around-the-clock telephone number. The toll-free numbers are available for users from Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, as well as the “order hotline” which is reachable Monday to Friday, from 9 AM to 5 PM. There is even Host Europe's postal address if you feel like writing them an old-fashioned letter and recalling the “old days”. Alternatively, you can browse their “Forms and documents” section for questions related to terms of service, and it is available both in English and German. There is also a well-equipped FAQ section (it’s closer to a knowledge base), but it still isn’t translated into English, which means all users who don’t understand German are left to fend for themselves. Unfortunately, there is no community forum as a final resort before reaching the support personnel. If you want a well-rounded host that will give you more than enough time to decide whether you want to stay with them or part your ways, HostGator may be worth a look. Besides offering an ample 45-day money-back guarantee, it is also geared towards English-speaking users making itself more attractive to an international market than Host Europe.Another US-based alternative to Host Europe is Bluehost, a host that is known for its pocket-friendly pricing and not particularly pocket-friendly price spike after the promotional period. Although with Host Europe there is a one-off setup fee with all monthly plans, at least you won’t have to worry about any sudden price spikes.If you are looking for a simple solution from Germany aimed at personal sites or small businesses, a Berlin-based Strato might be worth a try. Although their scope of hosting solution seems somewhat limited, all their plans support multiple-domain hosting, come with a free domain, a free SSL certificate, plenty of one-click installs, a website builder, and a 30-day “no quibble” money-back guarantee. Unlike Host Europe, Strato doesn’t offer a monthly billing option, although the one you get with Host Europe will set you back with a one-off setup fee.Hostinger is one of the most popular hosts from Europe. It offers its users an access to its servers which are found all around the world including the Americas, Europe, and Asia. Thanks to its 14-day “observation” period you can try out everything for yourselves without a need to worry about your budget. Unfortunately, you will not get such a chance with Host Europe.Host Europe is an award-winning veteran from Germany trusted by over 250.000 customers as we write, and the number keeps on growing. If you can come to terms with data centers in Germany and France (kind of), self-help options being in German only, somewhat sluggish sign-up procedure, and considerable one-off setup fees (with monthly plans), be sure to give Host Europe a chance. If not, HostGator or Bluehost might be a better choice. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!Thank you for signing up to TechRadar.

<title>Atlas VPN review | TechRadar</title>
<content>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more By Mike Williams 12 November 2021 Atlas VPN misses in some areas with its underpowered apps and feeble support site, but there's also plenty to like – it's P2P friendly, with great WireGuard-powered download speeds and no device limits for a very, very low price. Factor in the experience it'll gain after being acquired by NordVPN, and we think Atlas only gets better from.Atlas VPN misses in some areas with its underpowered apps and feeble support site, but there's also plenty to like – it's P2P friendly, with great WireGuard-powered download speeds and no device limits for a very, very low price. Factor in the experience it'll gain after being acquired by NordVPN, and we think Atlas only gets better from.Atlas VPN is a capable VPN provider which offers a decent all-round service for some of the lowest prices around.There's support for the speedy WireGuard protocol, for instance. You get apps for Windows, Mac, iOS and Android, a kill switch to protect you if the VPN drops, and the service allows unlimited simultaneous connections.A SafeSwap feature changes your IP address regularly while you're connected to the same server, maximizing your anonymity.Bonus features include ad and malware blocking, while data breach monitoring alerts you if any of your personal details are found on the dark web.Atlas VPN's network is smaller than many, with 700 servers spread across 27 countries. It'll be enough for many users, though, and P2P is supported everywhere.The really interesting news here came in October 2021, when Nord Security (the company behind NordVPN) announced it had acquired Atlas VPN. That tells you, all on its own, that Atlas isn't just another identikit VPN provider: there's some substance here, something worth buying. And although Atlas VPN will continue as an independent provider, it'll surely benefit in future from Nord Security's resources and experience.Atlas VPN's free no-registration-required plan gives you an easy way to try out the service, though with a couple of significant limits: 400MB per day for data, and three locations only (Amsterdam, New York, Los Angeles).That's not bad, and outperforms the free competition in some areas. Avira's Phantom VPN limits you to 500MB a month, for instance. Avast One's VPN has a generous 5GB a week data allowance, but doesn't support changing locations. ProtonVPN's free offering still wins out for its unlimited data and 12 locations.Opting for a paid plan drops the data and location limits. Prices start at an average $9.99 for monthly billing, and you can pay by card, PayPal and Google Pay. Upgrade to an annual account and the price plummets to just $2.49 a month, while the three-year plan is an amazing $1.39 a month (okay, only for the first term, and it's $3.99 on renewal, but that still looks like a good deal to us).Too good to be true? We'll check that later, but if you sign up and are unhappy, you're protected by a 30-day money-back guarantee.Beware, though: plans automatically renew when you sign up, and there's no way to change this or cancel your account from the control panel. You must email support and ask for help.Atlas VPN has the privacy basics covered with its WireGuard support, AES-256 encryption, kill switch and private DNS system.Unusual extras like rotating IP addresses along with ad and tracker-blocking should bring extra privacy protection.Atlas VPN's own policies aren't as impressive. Access its website for the first time and its cookie disclaimer only has an 'Accept' option, for instance. If you give the company your email address, you're opted in to receive marketing emails unless you specifically say otherwise. And the Blacklight Privacy Inspector found the site used Google Analytics, Facebook and assorted other tracking technologies.(Don't take our or Blacklight's word for it – even Atlas VPN's anti-tracker technology decided it was best to block three trackers on its own website.)Atlas VPN has been through what it calls an independent security audit, but this is just about as limited as we've seen.The exercise only covered the iOS app, for instance. It was a black box review, which means the auditors tested the functionality of the app, but didn't see the source code. And although Atlas VPN quoted some of the results in a blog post, it hasn't published the full report, so there's no way to judge it for ourselves.Okay, this is better than nothing, but only just, and it can't match the best of the competition. TunnelBear has annual audits of its apps, servers and backend infrastructure, for instance, and publishes the results for everyone to see.Atlas VPN claims to have a 'solid no-logs policy', saying 'we do not collect details on our users' activities, DNS queries, or other data that could be linked to our users.'The privacy policy says Atlas VPN's apps collect some device data, though. This includes: 'device type, model, brand name (e.g. Samsung, Apple), OS version, device ID, language, time zone, coarse location (city scale).'It also mentions using 'attribution analytics to track install source and traffic source', and 'advertising IDs to measure performance of our campaigns.'Put it all together and there's nothing to indicate Atlas VPN logs any of your online activities. It does have enough data to build user profiles, though, including details on user devices, when they connect and the amount of data they use. And as Atlas VPN hasn't had its no logging claims audited, there's no independent evidence to tell us if it's living up to its promises.The Windows app is basic, and covers only the VPN fundamentals: a location list of cities, a Connect/Disconnect button, and a handful of settings. (The latter consists of a 'Start on launch' option, an On/Off toggle for the kill switch, and a choice of WireGuard or IKEv2 protocols.)The developer hasn't paid much attention to usability. The location list covers cities, for instance, but they're not grouped by country or sorted in any order we could recognize. ('Germany, Serbia, USA - New Jersey, Hong Kong, Poland, Japan' is a part of the sequence – can you see any pattern?)There's no Favorites system or Recently Used list, either, so changing location is always going to require some scrolling.Our connection attempts failed sometimes with the free Atlas servers, perhaps a sign that they're overloaded. But this wasn't an issue once we upgraded, and connection times were decent at an average 5-6 seconds.Atlas claims its app has malware and ad blocking. There's no sign of this in the app itself, though, and it made no visible difference to us. We saw far better results by installing the free uBlock Origin.Our kill switch tests began with us simulating a dropped VPN. The good news is the kill switch immediately blocked our internet, ensuring we couldn't use the unprotected connection. The bad news – well, where to begin?The app didn't raise an alert when the VPN failed, for instance. It didn't try to reconnect, either. In a real-world situation you might easily waste time checking networks, rebooting your device, or even the router, before you figured out why your internet was down.Usually we could restore normal operations by hitting the Connect button. Sometimes this failed, though, with the app recommending we turned off the kill switch. What, it even blocked its own internet access? Really?We reluctantly agreed to turn the kill switch off, and the app then connected. But when we checked Settings, the kill switch was still marked as on – it hadn't been disabled, after all.Confused? Us too. Overall, the kill switch protected us from dropped connections, and that's what matters most. But the app could do a lot more to keep users informed, and get the VPN up and running again at the maximum possible speed.Desktop VPN apps normally beat their mobile VPN cousins for features, but not here. Atlas VPN's Android app outperforms its Windows offering in several areas.The location list works as expected, for instance, with countries grouped by continent and sorted alphabetically.There's a separate list of Streaming Servers, apparently optimized to reduce buffering, something not included on the desktop build.Settings are essentially the same as Windows, including a kill switch and support for WireGuard and IKEv2 protocols.An Assistant page hosts a tracker blocking feature and the Data Breach Monitor, more options that we couldn't find on Windows. We ran a quick check of these, and found they offered some value. Turning on tracker blocking protected us from some trackers, and entering an email into the Data Breach Monitor listed some of the breaches where our credentials were exposed.Atlas VPN's iOS app also improves on the Windows client with its sensibly sorted location list, tracker blocking and Data Breach Monitor options. It's a little short on features, though, with no WireGuard support or kill switch.Atlas VPN's support website is a little limited, and that's putting it politely. There are very few articles, most don't cover the topics you need, and many of what's left only have a few lines of content.The Troubleshooting section is a great example. We hoped to see some sound general advice on installation problems, issues with app features or download speeds. Instead, we found only four articles on very specific issues, such as 'How to fix error 13801 on Windows?' and 'What if my PC does not support Atlas VPN 64-bit?'(And if you're expecting any depth with the help provided, prepare for disappointment. This is the entire and unedited answer to that last question: 'No need to worry if your Windows device does not support Atlas VPN 64-bit: you can download the 32-bit version here.')Atlas VPN has no live chat support, but you can contact the company via email. We sent a message with a couple of simple product questions. Does the Windows app have tracker blocking? And which, if any of the apps block malicious websites or ads, as none of them mention it anywhere?A reply arrived just over two hours later, not bad for a response time.The message read: 'The mentioned features are currently being tested, therefore they are not available on all platforms. They should be rolled out to other OS'es soon, however, we are unable to provide an exact ETA as it may be misleading.'As Atlas VPN couldn't tell us which apps support malicious website or ad blocking, we'll assume the feature isn't available yet. That might have changed by the time you read this, but if it's a priority for you, ask the company before you sign up.Atlas VPN hadn't always impressed us so far, but it got off to a great unblocking start by getting us into BBC iPlayer.Accessing US Amazon was more difficult than usual, as it asked us to complete a CAPTCHA first. IP reputation service IPQualityScore revealed that our Atlas server IP address had a fraud rating of 100, with recent abuse reported. That's not anything directly to do with Atlas VPN, but it suggests the free plan and low prices might make the company especially appealing to hackers. That makes for more blacklisted IPs, and could mean more CAPTCHAS and other security hassles for you.Once we'd accessed US Amazon Prime, though, Atlas allowed us to stream content right away. We moved on to Disney Plus and were able to access that site, too.US Netflix is the jewel in the unblocking crown, though, and it was out of Atlas VPN's reach. We weren't able to view content from any of Atlas VPN's US servers.We measure VPN performance by running several benchmarking services – SpeedTest's website and command line app, SpeedOf.me, nPerf – from both a UK data center and a US residential location. We run each benchmark five times using WireGuard and OpenVPN (where available), run them a second time several hours later (that's a minimum of 120 tests), then analyze the data to see what's going on.Atlas VPN doesn't support OpenVPN, but its IKEv2 speeds were reasonable at a mid-range 260-320Mpps in the US, 170-210Mbps in the UK.Switching to WireGuard made a big difference, though, with speeds jumping to 590-600Mbps in the UK, and 650-800Mbps in the US. That's not quite a performance leader – NordVPN peaked at 880Mbps, IPVanish at 900Mbps – but it beat names like Windscribe (430-480Mbps), StrongVPN (450Mbps) and Surfshark (450-475Mbps).Atlas VPN may not have the best network, or apps, or support site – for those, you'd have to go for a more established provider like ExpressVPN. But now it's owned by Nord Security, we'd expect to see some improvements. And even right now, Atlas VPN's speeds are good, it unblocks more sites than many, and the three-year plan is as cheap as you'll see anywhere.Mike began his career as a lead software developer in the engineering world, where his creations were used by big-name companies from Rolls Royce to British Nuclear Fuels and British Aerospace.

<title>Calendar.com review | TechRadar</title>
<content>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more By Stefan Ionescu 11 November 2021 Calendar.com is a long-standing name on the market for calendar apps, and its developers have put a lot of effort into making it a good, well-rounded solution. The interface is very light on the eyes and works smoothly, and the app itself offers lots of different features aimed at users with specific needs. It comes in several pricing tiers – including a free one – that allow users to pick the version that best matches their individual preferences. Calendar.com is a long-standing name on the market for calendar apps, and its developers have put a lot of effort into making it a good, well-rounded solution. The interface is very light on the eyes and works smoothly, and the app itself offers lots of different features aimed at users with specific needs. It comes in several pricing tiers – including a free one – that allow users to pick the version that best matches their individual preferences. If you’ve spent some time looking for a good calendar app, you’ve probably noticed that the market tends to be divided into two main categories. On one hand, we have apps aimed at individual users, offering a small but solid set of features that fit most needs. On the other hand, there are also the more advanced, professional calendar apps that offer lots of features and are designed to work best in large organizations.Calendar.com is a little bit of both, with features that can make it an attractive choice for regular home users, while also offering a competent professional package suitable for organizations of different sizes. The app is offered on multiple platforms as well, making it one of the most versatile offers on the market at the moment. Users can easily check out the free version and then upgrade to one of the premium tiers, and it doesn’t take long to set it up on different devices.There are three plans available – Free, Standard ($6/month), and Pro ($8/month). The free plan comes with pretty much everything one might need for regular daily use, and doesn’t lock any critical features behind a paywall, unlike some competing apps. Users on this tier can connect to one calendar on an external platform, and will have one basic workspace to use. It’s worth noting that up to five members can be added to a single workspace, even on a free tier, which makes the app better for collaboration for those who don’t want to pay for a premium solution.The two premium tiers add a variety of extra features aimed primarily at users in organizations. This includes the ability to sync more calendars under a single account, unlimited workspace members, meetings with 25 and even 50 guests, and analytics that can help you gain a deeper understanding of your scheduling habits. Calendar.com comes with all standard features you would expect to find in a modern calendar app. You can view your schedule in different modes – day/week/month/year, and can easily share your calendar with other users, including those on Google services. Free users can set up meetings with up to 5 attendants, and the app offers advanced scheduling options to help you find the best available timeslot.Some of the features offered by Calendar.com can’t be found in other similar apps, or at least not often – such as the ability to embed calendars in web pages, and the native Zapier integration. Zoom integration is available as well, though only on the premium tiers. For most individual users, this shouldn’t matter much, but for those planning to use Calendar.com in an organization, subscribing to one of the premium tiers will be a good idea. The interface of Calendar.com doesn’t shine with anything unusual, but it gets the job done more or less fine. The app leans towards a more minimalistic design, hiding elements that are not used frequently and focusing on the major parts of the interface. That said, you should find it very easy to dig up any feature you might need, and it doesn’t take long to get used to the way the interface is organized.The app does tend to flow a bit better with a premium subscription, mainly because it unlocks its full range of features. The free tier still has its benefits though – especially for those looking for simplicity and a clean design. Some users might find the additional features in the premium tiers confusing, since many of them are aimed at organizations and similar use cases. Give the free version a try before deciding to upgrade to a premium plan, as it might work just fine for your specific needs.The company provides standard email support on top of their help knowledge base, and they additionally offer some special options to premium subscribers. If you’re on the Standard or Pro tier, you can get in touch with support representatives over the phone, and your inquiries will be prioritized. Free users will still get support, but in a more limited capacity. Most of the problems you may encounter during your use of the app should already be covered in the knowledgebase in any case.Calendar.com manages to stand out with its set of features and pricing plans. The app faces direct competition from Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, and other popular solutions like Fantastical. It still has a dedicated user base, and some have been with it for many years at this point. Choosing between Calendar.com and some of its popular competitors is mostly about personal choice with regards to things like interface organization and pricing, and the app is definitely worth checking out if you’re currently comparing the different options on the market.The app does a great job on all fronts, and can be equally useful to individuals as well as large organizations. It takes some time to get used to how it works, but after that, everything is quite easy. The strong support it receives from its developers is nothing but a huge plus as well, so if you’re looking for a good calendar app that covers all important bases at a reasonable price, look no further.We've also featured the best calendar apps and best time management appsStefan has always been a lover of tech.

<title>FastVPN review | TechRadar</title>
<content>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more By Mike Williams 12 November 2021 Seriously cheap for the first year, but you can see why: the desktop apps are unreliable, and there are very features. For unblocking Netflix and basic tasks only.Seriously cheap for the first year, but you can see why: the desktop apps are unreliable, and there are very features. For unblocking Netflix and basic tasks only.FastVPN is a simple VPN owned by Namecheap, the popular domain registrar and web hosting service.If you're wondering why you should trust a domain registrar to run your VPN, good question. No need to worry, though; it's using servers run by an arm of StackPath, which has also provided the network for major VPN brands such as IPVanish and StrongVPN.Whoever owns the network, it's a decent size, with 1,000+ P2P-friendly servers spread across 75+ locations worldwide. Apps are available for Windows, Mac, iOS and Android; tutorials show how to set up the service on Linux and various routers, and, unusually, there are no annoying limits on the number of devices you can connect at one time.The feature list is basic, though, covering the bare essentials only. You get OpenVPN and IKEv2 protocol support (no WireGuard), secure DNS to reduce the chance of DNS leaks, a kill switch to block internet access if the VPN drops, and that's about it.FastVPN's starting prices are some of the lowest around, thanks to big discounts off your first term.Sign up for the monthly plan, for instance, and you'll pay nothing at all for the first month, effectively a 30-day free trial, rising to a still-excellent $5.88 on renewal.The annual plan is just $1 a month for year one, rising to $2.88 on renewal. There are no longer-term plans (the old three-year option has disappeared.)These are very low first-term prices (and they're pretty good on renewal, too). Private Internet Access is one of our go-to VPNs for value, but with monthly plans at $9.95, dropping to $3.33 paid annually, it's still no match for FastVPN.If you are tempted, you're able to by card or PayPal, and there's a 30-day money-back guarantee to protect you if it all goes wrong.The FastVPN website comments briefly on logging, saying you'll "keep your browsing activities to yourself with our strict no-log policy" and that the service "won’t track, collect, or share any of your logs". We searched the website for something more detailed, without any luck. The only extra information we found came from the Windows VPN app installer, which warned that it collected "aggregated anonymous app usage data, including your device and OS version so we can troubleshoot and improve our app", but "that's it", and that there's "no tracking of your personal identifiable information".We'd like a little more substance than that, and ideally a security or no-logging audit, but that doesn't seem likely to happen any time soon. FastVPN is targeted at the average consumer who wants something easy to use which 'just works', and not the kind of user who cares about session logging or whether it uses AES-256-CBC or GCM.FastVPN's Windows app opens with a default 'Best Available' server choice, and a 'Connect VPN' button. The client displays the name of your current network, too, a handy way to be sure you're connecting to the official coffee shop Wi-Fi, and not some shady open network nearby.A location picker to the left gives a list of countries (some with city-level choices), server load and ping time information (you can sort by those, too), simple Favorites system to easily group your most commonly used locations.Although this looked good in theory, real-world performance was poor. OpenVPN connections took up to 40 seconds, three to four times faster than we usually see, and IKEv2 connections were also poor at 18-20 seconds.That was just the start. Occasionally, after connecting, we found we couldn't access any websites. Sometimes the VPN dropped, complaining of various internal errors or that there was 'no network detected.' It didn't help that some of these error messages were layered on top of normal status information, making them difficult to read. Not a huge issue, but it all helps to create a poor impression of the app. We expect better from a big company such as Namecheap.Settings are relatively limited: auto-start options, a choice of protocol (IKEv2, OpenVPN TCP/ UDP, and a Scramble option to help bypass VPN blocking), and a kill switch to block internet access if the VPN drops.The app handled unexpected disconnects very well. We forcibly closed our IKEv2 connection, the app noticed, displayed a notification and reconnected at once. So, we closed the connection again, then kept closing it, as fast we could, interrupting every reconnect attempt. That's a level of stress testing which goes way beyond what you're likely to see in real life, but the app just waited until we'd finished, then reconnected as before.The kill switch generally worked well, too. Whatever we did to IKEv2 or OpenVPN connections, the app raised an alert, wasn't especially troubled by our extreme testing methods and reconnected as soon as it could, without ever leaving us unprotected. FastVPN's Android VPN app looks and feels very similar to the Windows edition: big green Connect button, by default you're connected to the nearest server, but you can choose something else from a searchable list of locations.We noticed small usability issues. The desktop app hides city locations by default, and they're only visible if you expand a specific country. The mobile app displays city and country names in the same list, so there's much more scrolling (and the cities aren't always displayed in alphabetical order, either.) Settings are basic, too, with protocol options reduced to OpenVPN UDP or TCP (no IKEv2, this time).FastVPN's iOS app is very similar, but does add one very useful feature. An Always On option enables automatically connecting to the VPN whenever you access untrusted networks, while also ignoring networks you know are safe (home, work, etc).These apps aren't bad, and they didn't have the technical issues we saw on the desktop. But they're also short on features, and can't begin to compete with the best VPNs.FastVPN doesn't make any specific claims about its website-unblocking abilities, but generally suggests it can help you 'securely unblock sites and content.'This certainly worked as a BBC iPlayer VPN, where FastVPN got us access with the first location we tried.The service scored an even big victory when it unblocked US Netflix, a task which defeats many big VPN names.But FastVPN couldn't keep up that level of success, and it failed with Amazon Prime Video and Disney+.That's not a bad result, but we've seen some providers do much better. CyberGhost, ExpressVPN, Hide.me, Private Internet Access, ProtonVPN and Surfshark all unblocked everything in their latest reviews.We measured FastVPN speeds from a UK data center with excellent connectivity and a 1Gbps connection, giving us room to see exactly what the service could do.FastVPN turned out to be not so fast after all, with both OpenVPN and IKEv2 speeds reaching a modest 250Mbps. That's better than some - NordVPN and IPVanish didn't reach 200Mbps with OpenVPN - but a long way behind OpenVPN leaders such as HideMyAss! (340-350Mbps), Hide.me (390Mbps) and ProtonVPN (400-460Mbps.)There's another problem. OpenVPN is the fastest protocol FastVPN supports, but most providers give you much more capable options. IPVanish's WireGuard connections hit 750-900Mbps in recent reviews, for instance, while NordVPN's NordLynx was a close match at 760-880Mbps.So despite the name, there's no chance this service will appear in our list of the truly fastest VPNs. But although FastVPN trails far behind in the speed stakes, it's also far from the worst we've seen, and the service should handle most browsing or streaming tasks with ease.FastVPN's ultra-low starter prices caught our eye, but the Windows app was unreliable and there are very few features. Could work as a cheap VPN for unblocking Netflix and other basic tasks, but this isn't the service for experienced or demanding users. Assuming you want something better, we'd suggest going for our #1 rated ExpressVPN or, to save on costs, the also brilliant Surfshark.Mike began his career as a lead software developer in the engineering world, where his creations were used by big-name companies from Rolls Royce to British Nuclear Fuels and British Aerospace.

<title>Zoho Recruit review | TechRadar</title>
<content>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more By Mike Jennings 12 November 2021 Zoho Recruit offers excellent features that are easy to use though this recruitment tool can be expensive for smaller businesses.Zoho Recruit offers excellent features that are easy to use though this recruitment tool can be expensive for smaller businesses.Zoho Recruit is one of the biggest Applicant Tracking System (ATS) services in the world, so it’s going to be right at the top of most people’s lists if they need some help with their hunt for top-quality staff.There’s plenty going for Zoho Recruit, including a free option and a broad range of features. Still, we’ve also got questions about some of the firm’s support options and integration abilities.Zoho Recruit has a broad range of features that are divided into three kinds of product – one for companies, another for recruitment agencies and a third for people who need to hire temporary staff.The Corporate HR product allows you to post job openings to hundreds of different mainstream and niche job boards, and you can boost job listings on social networks. You can also search through resumes with AI-powered modules that will find candidates on your behalf. You can set up a dedicated resume inbox and invite recruiters to submit potential candidates through a portal with your own branding. You can also establish an employee referral portal to allow your existing staff to give recommendations.Zoho’s AI features are robust and impressive. Applicants can be graded in advance based on your preferred traits and requirements, and advanced searches help narrow down the candidate pool.You can use Zoho’s background screening module to run background checks so you can adhere to your preferred hiring practices, and you can ask candidates to complete pre-screening assessments to help eliminate unsuitable people and streamline the process.HR staff and candidates can access dedicated portals to track the status of applications, and Zoho allows you to track recruitment stats and analyze data. Thanks to a customized series of alerts, rules, and actions, corporate HR staff can also automate much of the recruitment process. Impressively, Zoho’s entire experience can be customized, from the branding and aesthetic of the software to custom tabs and layout options.Switch over to Zoho’s agency module, and you get the same features alongside options to have powerful client portals that allow agency clients to create vacancies easily, send feedback and invite people to interview. And if you use Zoho’s temporary staff product, you’ll receive help from straightforward and powerful scheduling and timesheet tools alongside electronic signatures and invoicing to speed up laborious parts of the process. Temporary workers can also access their own portal to mark their availability and view their workloads.Zoho does have good features, but some things are missing here too. Zoho Recruit has integrations with Outlook, LinkedIn, Google Suite, and a selection of other products and services, but you’ll find more integration ability elsewhere.This service doesn’t have as many behavioral, skill, and cognitive testing options as some other recruitment services, either. You only get 24/7 support if you pay extra, too – standard plans only have support five days of the week.Zoho’s broader company offers a full range of HR products, which is excellent if you want to pick and choose features or opt for a more comprehensive HR solution. Sadly, though, that means you don’t get onboarding unless you pay more.Zoho’s standard Corporate HR package costs $25 per month if you buy annually, and you get the service’s core features alongside candidate sourcing, resume management, tracking, and Google, Zoho, and Microsoft Outlook integrations. If you buy the $50 per month Enterprise product, you get AI-powered candidate matching, improvement portal management, and advanced customization. On top of that, you’ll need to pay extra for hiring manager and vendor portal licenses.Recruitment agencies can pay for $25, $50, and $75 tiers, with the two latter options adding extra features. That $50 choice adds AI matching, advanced analytics, better security control, portal management, and candidate assessment options. The top-tier service adds more customization and portal options.The temporary employee package has a simple, single price of $59 a month, although you’ll have to pay more if you want to hire more than 25 employees.Zoho Recruit’s three products also have free tiers that give you candidate management, interview scheduling, and simple resume search options alongside other basic features. Still, these options are restrictive – HR departments can only list one vacancy at a time, and the temporary staff package is limited to five people.Zoho Recruit has an impressive selection of features, no matter which package you choose. It doesn’t require a huge amount of technical knowledge to use and excels when it comes to customization and AI-powered extras. It offers a broad slate of recruitment options for HR departments, temporary staff needs, and agencies, and it can be easily incorporated into a wider HR product if necessary.The costs can mount up, especially if you want a full HR or recruitment solution, and you may want to look elsewhere if you need more testing options, extension integration, or better support.For most companies and agencies, though, Zoho Recruit will prove excellent, and is one of the recruitment services you need to consider.We've also featured the best recruitment platforms, best HR software and best background check servicesSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!Thank you for signing up to TechRadar.

<title>iTop VPN | TechRadar</title>
<content>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more By Mike Williams 12 November 2021 iTop VPN's generous 700MB/day (21GB/month) free plan might be worth a look for simple, non-privacy-critical tasks, but the service has too many fundamental issues to justify handing over your cash.iTop VPN's generous 700MB/day (21GB/month) free plan might be worth a look for simple, non-privacy-critical tasks, but the service has too many fundamental issues to justify handing over your cash.iTop VPN is a free VPN service with an affordable paid plan and one or two unusual privacy extras.The free plan gives you 700MB of data per day (21GB per month), and a choice of 16 locations (including the US and UK), easily beating most of the competition.Paying for a subscription gets you access to 100+ locations and 1,800+ streaming and gaming-optimized servers. (P2P is supported, too, though only on a handful of specialist servers.)A longer-than-usual list of bonus features include split tunneling, along with ad, tracker and malware blocking, browser history cleaning, and a Security Reinforce tool checks your device privacy settings and warns of any problems.iTop VPN has apps for Windows, Mac (a recent addition), Android and iOS, and support for connecting up to five devices simultaneously.This VPN's monthly plan is priced at $11.99, not the highest we've seen, but more expensive than most.Paying six months upfront cuts the cost to $6.99 a month, but that's still above average. You're paying iTop $41.94 to get your six months of cover, for instance, but Private Internet Access only asks $39.95 for a full year ($3.33 a month).iTop isn't done yet, though. Opt for its annual plan and you'll get an extra year thrown in, giving you two year's protection for $2.31 a month. A handful of providers are even cheaper – Private Internet Access has a three-year plan for $2.19 a month, Ivacy and PrivadoVPN go even lower – but that still looks like a real bargain.iTop supports payments via card, PayPal and bank transfers. It's good to see that you can turn off auto-renewal when you purchase the service, too, ensuring you won't accidentally pay for a second term that you don't want.Even better, if you're unhappy, a 15-day 'no questions asked' money-back guarantee (7 days for monthly-billed plans) means you're able to get your first payment back, too.Most VPNs protect your privacy by using secure VPN protocols such as WireGuard and OpenVPN. This doesn't guarantee you'll be safe – a provider can easily make mistakes in how they're set up – but they're open source, so anyone can see how they work or check the code for problems.However, iTop uses a custom scheme of its own. The Windows app appears to make a fast proxy connection to the VPN server, then uses an open source package called WinDivert to direct your traffic through the tunnel, apparently encrypting it with iTop's own protocol.Maybe this is secure, maybe it's not, but the company doesn't provide enough information to judge. You can't check the encryption it uses, for instance.We noticed a separate privacy issue on the iTop VPN website. Its SSL certificate wasn't properly configured, and this allowed us to access areas of the site, including the Login page, using an unencrypted HTTP connection. Unless you're using the VPN, that risks exposing your credentials to snoopers.iTop scores another privacy thumbs-down for its order form, where it insisted we entered our full name, city and post or ZIP code. A tooltip tried to justify this by saying that the details 'allow us to contact you if there are any issues with your order.' Uh, isn't that what our email address is for?iTop VPN claims to have a no logging policy, and the privacy policy spells out what this means.The company does its best to sound reassuring, telling users: 'We do not log your activity while you are utilizing the Services, including your browsing history, the bandwidth you used, or how long you connected to VPN servers. We do not store your original IP address or the server IP address that you connect to.'Sounds good, but we already know this can't be entirely true. iTop VPN limits its free plan to 700MB a day, so to make this work it must log the bandwidth you use and associate it with a device ID.Scroll down the page and you'll find a 'What information we collect' section, which could also include a lot of data: '...operating system, device ID, Internet protocol addresses, browser type, browser language, referring/exit pages, clickstream data of our websites and our products or services, and the pages or features of our software or services accessed by you and the time spent there.'Some of that looks like it's referring to the website, not iTop's apps, but the fact that we're left to guess is a problem. A privacy policy should be clear and precise, not leave us with more questions than it answers.Whatever you think of iTop VPN's claims, the real problem here is the company hasn't had them confirmed by any kind of security or logging audit. We're left to take iTop on trust, and hope the firm is delivering what it promises.iTop VPN's apps look good and are stuffed with features, but also score poorly on many of the usability fundamentals.Hitting a big red Connect button should by default automatically connect you to the nearest server, for instance. But even though we were testing from the UK, the free app regularly connected us to Japan, and the paid plan sometimes chose Germany.An 'All Servers' list enables switching to another location, but this also isn't as easy as it should be. For example, the countries aren't sorted by name, continent, distance or any other order we could recognize (there are sequences like Korea, Russia, UK, Italy, Singapore and so on). And there's no Favorites system or Recently Used lists to help out.The app is missing some usability shortcuts we commonly see elsewhere. You can't double click a location name to connect, for instance – you must click a location's Connect button, instead. When the app does connect (or disconnect), there's no notification to alert you, so you won't know whether you're protected unless you keep an eye on the app interface.On the plus side, you get separate Streaming, Social and Gaming lists where you can view locations optimized for specific platforms (PUBG, Warzone, Netflix, Disney Plus, Amazon Prime, iPlayer, Hulu and more).Too much scrolling? The Quick Access pane lists 17 common reasons for using a VPN: Browse Privacy, Hide Location, Watch Netflix, Play PUBG, Unblock WhatsApp (or Telegram, Facebook, Twitter etc), and more. If you're looking to unblock Netflix, there's no need to scan down a lengthy list of servers and try to guess which is best: just tap 'Watch Netflix' and the app automatically chooses a location for you.These work well, and we like the flexibility. But we'd prefer iTop VPN to sort out some of the interface basics before it layers on any more extras.iTop VPN's Mac app mostly looks like the Windows build, but with a few very noticeable changes.There's no Downloading section, for instance – the P2P locations are in the 'All Servers' lists. The Quick Tasks section doesn't have a Play PUBG tile. There's no kill switch and no Settings menu (the Protocols list is now on the main screen). If you regularly use both the Windows and Mac apps, the differences could be a little confusing.The iOS app is all about simplicity, with no Settings menu, no kill switch, no P2P, no HTTPS protocol option, and absolutely no bonus privacy tools. Instead, you just get the location lists, a big Connect button and a choice of TCP/UDP protocols.There's good news in one iOS area. Cities are grouped into countries, making for a shorter and better-organized list. But it's still not sorted alphabetically (and to make it worse, the iOS app uses a different order to the Windows build).The Android app is essentially the iOS version with added split tunneling, and yet another sort order for the servers list. Not a big deal unless you're using iTop VPN on several platforms – only then will you need to remember where your favorite locations appear on each device.iTop VPN supports a kill switch to stop internet traffic if the VPN drops unexpectedly. We found the Windows app was mostly successful, but had some flaws. When we forcibly crashed the app, for instance, our VPN connection dropped, the kill switch didn't kick in, and our traffic was unprotected. And as the app doesn't raise any notifications, an affected user is unlikely to realize they're at risk in such a scenario.Split tunneling support allows you to decide which apps use the tunnel, and which don't. It's handy if you only need the VPN to unblock a couple of websites, say, as other apps can use your normal (and faster) connection. This worked well for us, directing only browsers through the VPN by default, but making it easy to add other apps as required.A DNS Protection feature claims to protect your DNS settings from modification by malware. You can also set your DNS to one of several public DNS providers, simply by choosing them from a list: Google, OpenDNS, Verizon, Comodo and DNS Advantage.The app has a handful of settings. You're able to launch it when Windows starts, optionally connect, and choose one of three protocol options: UDP, TCP and HTTPS. As iTop VPN doesn't use any standard VPN protocol, it's not completely clear what the effects of these settings might be, and the descriptions don't help much. (Choosing TCP apparently gets you 'high level privacy', for instance, while opting for UDP means faster speeds but 'more data usage for special occasions.')iTop VPN is also missing some of the more advanced settings we see with other apps. It won't automatically connect when you access insecure Wi-Fi, for example. There are no leak protection options, and we saw no way to control notifications.iTop VPN has some privacy and security extras that we've not seen with other VPNs.A Security Reinforce module scanned our PC for weak or non-standard security settings, then suggested appropriate changes. You'll need some technical knowledge to understand its report, but the advice looks good to us, and is likely to improve your system security.The Browser Privacy feature can check and clear your browsing tracks in Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Opera and even Internet Explorer.These tools aren't the best we've seen, and they're maybe not all suitable for a VPN. Most providers use their own DNS servers rather than OpenVPN or Google, for instance, as that ensures no one else gets to see the sites you visit.But there's also more power here than we expected. DNS Protection isn't something iTop VPN threw together in an afternoon, for instance – it's an IObit feature taken direct from IObit Malware Fighter. Put it all together and the extras could have some value for more experienced users. (Although, as with the main app interface, we'd be happier if the developer sorted out the core features before starting with piling on the extras.)iTop VPN apps have specialist locations for unblocking many platforms, making them far easier to use than many competitors. If you're looking to unblock a supported platform in the US, say, you don't have to start choosing US locations until you find one that works: just choose a service from the list and you're ready to go.We tried this with BBC iPlayer, often a tricky site to unblock, but iTop VPN got us access right away.iTop VPN has Disney Plus locations in New York and Los Angeles. They both worked for us.There are streaming locations for Amazon Prime in the US and UK, but we weren't so lucky with these. Amazon spotted what we were doing, displayed its 'your device is connected to the internet using a VPN or proxy service' and demanded we 'disable it and try again.'It was the same disappointing story with Netflix: iTop VPN has a couple of specialist Netflix servers (US and Korea) but neither worked for us.Getting us into two of our four test sites isn't bad, but other providers do much better. CyberGhost, ExpressVPN, Hide.me, Hola, PrivadoVPN, Private Internet Access, ProtonVPN and Surfshark all unblocked every one of our test platforms in recent reviews.We measured iTop VPN speeds from US and UK locations with a 1Gbps connection in both cases, using several performance testing sites and services (SpeedTest's website and command line app, nPerf, SpeedOfme and more). We checked the download speeds at least five times from each site, and then we repeated all the tests in an evening session.UK download speeds were very ordinary at 180-190Mbps, but US performance was much better, with peak median speeds of around 360-400Mps, even reaching 900Mbps at one point. We're skeptical about that peak score, as it only happened in a single session out of the 20 we ran in the US, and none of the others got near even half that speed. We think the 360-400Mbps figure is more representative of what you're likely to see.That's not a bad result, and it's a close match with the OpenVPN performance we see from the likes of HideMyAss! (270-410Mbps) and TunnelBear (330-350Mbps).iTop's results lag well behind many other VPNs, though, especially when they're using WireGuard and faster protocols (providers such as CyberGhost, IPVanish and NordVPN regularly hit 750-900Mbps).There's another issue, too. That 330-350Mbps we saw from TunnelBear was using a standard OpenVPN connection with a very well-understood level of encryption and security. But iTop VPN uses the company's own custom protocol, which means we can't be sure these figures are a fair comparison. If iTop VPN is using more basic encryption, for instance, that might give it a big performance advantage, but at the cost of some security.iTop VPN has a stack of powerful extras, but it misses on a lot of the VPN fundamentals: there is no OpenVPN or WireGuard, limited unblocking, a flawed kill switch, plus various privacy issues. Its 700MB per day (21GB a month) free plan might be worth considering, but we wouldn't use it for anything privacy-critical.Mike began his career as a lead software developer in the engineering world, where his creations were used by big-name companies from Rolls Royce to British Nuclear Fuels and British Aerospace.

<title>Workable review | TechRadar</title>
<content>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more By Mike Jennings 12 November 2021 While Workable provides plenty of features for recruitment, many rivals go a bit further with their respective offerings.While Workable provides plenty of features for recruitment, many rivals go a bit further with their respective offerings.Workable is a dedicated recruitment platform and Applicant Tracking System and it doesn’t tie into a wider suite of HR products, so it’s got a focused and well-designed range of features.It’s not the cheapest recruitment solution around, though, so it’s going to have to impress if businesses are going to find room for Workable in their budgets.Workable’s features are divided into three strands – the first sources and attracts candidates, the second handles evaluation and interviews, and the third tackles hiring.Workable has one-click job posting to more than 200 job boards, and it integrates with your company’s social media channels so you can advertise your own vacancies. You can also use Workable’s own drag-and-drop system to build your corporate careers page, and job applications from various sources are collated into a single pipeline for easier management.Lots of the processes can be automated, too. Workable’s AI systems supply a list of up to 50 potential candidates when you post a new job – you don’t even have to wait for the resumes to roll in. This service can automatically create social adverts for your positions, and Workable’s Chrome extension can deliver in-depth candidate information based on their social media profiles.Recruiters can also use Workable’s powerful Boolean search options to find suitable candidates. Workable has internal application options and an employee referral platform that can include unique sharing links and referral rewards.Switch over to the evaluation and interview module, and you’ll find more helpful features. You can use more than 700 job description templates that are SEO-optimized, and you can customize your hiring pipeline for consistency and familiarity.The service supports two-way syncing with Gmail and Outlook accounts to help recruiters and candidates stay on the same page, and Workable has an app to allow staff to manage recruitment on the move. Elsewhere, you’ll find collaborative tools that can be used by your whole HR team and in-built support for video interviews, and you can automate candidate communication. Anonymized candidate screening enables more inclusive hiring, and you can assess candidates using skillset, personality, and cognitive ability tests – and then see all the data so you can make informed hiring decisions.Further automation streamlines the hiring process, and you can use a central workflow and timeline to keep staff abreast of hiring processes and budgets. Workable has built-in offer letters and electronic signatures, and Workable also supports national, international, and local regulations to help your company be fully compliant.Workable also integrates with software from Microsoft, Google, Facebook, and LinkedIn, and can also be used with HR tools from Glassdoor, Bamboo, and Indeed. Ultimately, there are dozens of third-party integrations here for products that handle video interviews, assessments, referrals, sourcing, and every other part of the recruitment process.Workable does have a broad range of features, but large companies may want more customization and abilities from an HR product that handles more than just the recruitment process. Workable also misses out on automated reference checking, and it doesn’t have any onboarding options beyond the ability to offer jobs to candidates.Workable’s software is divided into four different products. The Paygo option costs $99 per job posted per month, and it has Workable’s essential features but few of the advanced options – it’s billed as a self-service choice for companies that only hire occasionally.The Core, Growth, and Premier options supply added functionality – the Core option builds on the PayGo service, the Growth tier adds automation options and extra features alongside a dedicated account manager, and the Premier option unlocks every feature alongside bespoke onboarding for the service in your business.Workable doesn’t list the pricing for those three products, though. You’ll have to get in touch with the company and work out costs based on your company’s size and needs.Workable is a straightforward recruitment tool with a good range of features that deliver a well-balanced approach across the entire recruitment process.It’s particularly useful for small and medium-sized businesses who need recruitment software to integrate with other HR services they may use. Still, larger companies with their own HR staff or full-service third-party options may not find this dedicated product necessary.We've also featured the best recruitment platforms, best HR software and best background check servicesSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!Thank you for signing up to TechRadar.

<title>Host Europe web hosting review | TechRadar</title>
<content>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more By Mike Williams , Mirza Bahic 12 November 2021 Host Europe is a strong, stable, and feature-packed web hosting provider geared towards German-speaking customers. If you fall into this category, don’t hesitate to give them a chance.Host Europe is a strong, stable, and feature-packed web hosting provider geared towards German-speaking customers. If you fall into this category, don’t hesitate to give them a chance.Established in 1997 in Germany, Host Europe has become and remained rather successful since, continuing to offer web hosting solutions for individuals, small and medium-sized businesses. They say that their primary objective is to provide their customers with internet and server hosting with the highest quality possible. This rings true if we consider that they’ve collected more than a couple of rewards throughout the years.In the Readers' Choice Host Europe was voted as the best service provider of 2019, the second-best in 2020, and a second-best in the cloud hosting category. They were also awarded gold three times at the Hosting & Service Provider Summits and received other awards by HOSTtest.de and from the test portal CHIP for best-in-class accessibility.Host Europe was one among the brands of HEG (Host Europe Group), a web hosting, email, and domain name registrar giant founded in 1997, same as its subsidiary. In December 2016, HEG was acquired by GoDaddy, and its name is slowly being phased out if the news holds true. However, this shouldn’t impact Host Europe in any significant way.Host Europe is headquartered in Cologne and has two “energy-saving and secure” data centers in Cologne and Strasbourg. If you wish to find out more about these two, the “Technology” section on their website provides plenty of information on the matter.The official site of Host Europe looks and feels old-fashioned, although not necessarily in a bad way since it makes finding your way around rather simple. The site is available in German and English language and it features a good-looking blog, which, unfortunately, isn’t translated into English.You can find Host Europe on Facebook (which is in English although the articles linked there are often in German), and Twitter (which is openly exclusive to its German-speaking followers). Host Europe's solutions include shared hosting, WordPress hosting, ecommerce hosting, VPS, reseller hosting, and dedicated server hosting, as well as domain name registration, SSL certificates, backup storage, site security, Microsoft 365 tools, professional email, and a website builder.Although Host Europe's hosting plans are affordable in general, which of them you get to choose from depends on whether you want to pay on a monthly or an annual basis. The price is identical but if you want to commit for one month only you’ll also have to pay a €14.99 ($17.30) one-off setup fee.Regardless of the billing cycle, for €4.99 ($5.75) per month, the “Basic” plan will supply you with one annual domain, SSL, 50GB of storage space, two MySQL databases, one automated mailbox migration (included in the first 30 days), and Kaspersky virus protection. More expensive plans won’t add further features but increase the amount of storage space, the number of databases, and the number of antivirus software solutions.While Host Europe doesn’t offer a money-back guarantee, you can cancel your contract with them within four weeks.As for payment methods, Host Europe accepts all major credit cards, PayPal, and SEPA direct debit. To create an account with Host Europe you’ll have to provide your full name, phone number, email, and physical address, and think up a strong password. Here, you can choose whether you want to be contacted via email, phone, or both. Depending on your choice, you’ll receive an order confirmation via message or email together, containing extremely detailed explanations of the features you can expect to receive, the cancellation policy, and the General Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy.After adding your payment details and making a purchase, you’ll be transferred to Host Europe’s dashboard, which (unfortunately for non-German users) suffers from an incomplete translation to English. To be fair, most important information is fully translated to English, but there are still parts in German, including the FAQ section accessible through the dashboard.Since Host Europe is not the swiftest of providers, you may have to hang around for a while before finding out whether your order was accepted or not. If yes, you’ll still have to provide additional information about your order before you can start using the product you've purchased. As of late, Host Europe provides user-friendly cPanel with its Linux-based products, and Plesk is available with the Windows hosting packages - the two most popular control panels in the industry. As for website building, in addition to a whole variety of CMS options (WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, and so on), ecommerce apps (Magento, Blestan, OpenCart, and more), community building tools (phpBB, Booked, Dada Mail, and so forth) and other useful apps you can easily install via Installatron, you’ll also get a bare-bones version of a beginner-friendly website builder. To get more of everything (sites, webspace per site, templates, email accounts, and so forth) you’ll have to purchase one of the bigger website builder plans as an add-on. After putting Host Europe’s official site to the GTmetrix speed test, we got average results altogether. The time it took for the site to fully load was an amazing 1.3 seconds but all other vital speed measuring metrics (largest contentful paint, total blocking time, and cumulative layout shift) got trapped in the abyss of averageness pulling the final score down to B (74%).When it comes to uptime, Host Europe guarantees an availability of its data centers at 99.95% as a monthly mean, with the exclusion of scheduled (and unscheduled) maintenance windows. This can be translated into 4.5 hours of downtime annually, or about 10 minutes for two weeks.After monitoring the uptime of Host Europe's official site via UptimeRobot for two weeks, we recorded a worrying 55 minutes of downtime which dragged the total uptime to 99.76%, meaning that we should be getting some sweet credit as compensation.If you find yourself in need of a helping hand, you can try reaching Host Europe's team via email, fax, live chat, and, if you’re in a rush, around-the-clock telephone number. The toll-free numbers are available for users from Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, as well as the “order hotline” which is reachable Monday to Friday, from 9 AM to 5 PM. There is even Host Europe's postal address if you feel like writing them an old-fashioned letter and recalling the “old days”. Alternatively, you can browse their “Forms and documents” section for questions related to terms of service, and it is available both in English and German. There is also a well-equipped FAQ section (it’s closer to a knowledge base), but it still isn’t translated into English, which means all users who don’t understand German are left to fend for themselves. Unfortunately, there is no community forum as a final resort before reaching the support personnel. If you want a well-rounded host that will give you more than enough time to decide whether you want to stay with them or part your ways, HostGator may be worth a look. Besides offering an ample 45-day money-back guarantee, it is also geared towards English-speaking users making itself more attractive to an international market than Host Europe.Another US-based alternative to Host Europe is Bluehost, a host that is known for its pocket-friendly pricing and not particularly pocket-friendly price spike after the promotional period. Although with Host Europe there is a one-off setup fee with all monthly plans, at least you won’t have to worry about any sudden price spikes.If you are looking for a simple solution from Germany aimed at personal sites or small businesses, a Berlin-based Strato might be worth a try. Although their scope of hosting solution seems somewhat limited, all their plans support multiple-domain hosting, come with a free domain, a free SSL certificate, plenty of one-click installs, a website builder, and a 30-day “no quibble” money-back guarantee. Unlike Host Europe, Strato doesn’t offer a monthly billing option, although the one you get with Host Europe will set you back with a one-off setup fee.Hostinger is one of the most popular hosts from Europe. It offers its users an access to its servers which are found all around the world including the Americas, Europe, and Asia. Thanks to its 14-day “observation” period you can try out everything for yourselves without a need to worry about your budget. Unfortunately, you will not get such a chance with Host Europe.Host Europe is an award-winning veteran from Germany trusted by over 250.000 customers as we write, and the number keeps on growing. If you can come to terms with data centers in Germany and France (kind of), self-help options being in German only, somewhat sluggish sign-up procedure, and considerable one-off setup fees (with monthly plans), be sure to give Host Europe a chance. If not, HostGator or Bluehost might be a better choice. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!Thank you for signing up to TechRadar.

<title>Atlas VPN review | TechRadar</title>
<content>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more By Mike Williams 12 November 2021 Atlas VPN misses in some areas with its underpowered apps and feeble support site, but there's also plenty to like – it's P2P friendly, with great WireGuard-powered download speeds and no device limits for a very, very low price. Factor in the experience it'll gain after being acquired by NordVPN, and we think Atlas only gets better from.Atlas VPN misses in some areas with its underpowered apps and feeble support site, but there's also plenty to like – it's P2P friendly, with great WireGuard-powered download speeds and no device limits for a very, very low price. Factor in the experience it'll gain after being acquired by NordVPN, and we think Atlas only gets better from.Atlas VPN is a capable VPN provider which offers a decent all-round service for some of the lowest prices around.There's support for the speedy WireGuard protocol, for instance. You get apps for Windows, Mac, iOS and Android, a kill switch to protect you if the VPN drops, and the service allows unlimited simultaneous connections.A SafeSwap feature changes your IP address regularly while you're connected to the same server, maximizing your anonymity.Bonus features include ad and malware blocking, while data breach monitoring alerts you if any of your personal details are found on the dark web.Atlas VPN's network is smaller than many, with 700 servers spread across 27 countries. It'll be enough for many users, though, and P2P is supported everywhere.The really interesting news here came in October 2021, when Nord Security (the company behind NordVPN) announced it had acquired Atlas VPN. That tells you, all on its own, that Atlas isn't just another identikit VPN provider: there's some substance here, something worth buying. And although Atlas VPN will continue as an independent provider, it'll surely benefit in future from Nord Security's resources and experience.Atlas VPN's free no-registration-required plan gives you an easy way to try out the service, though with a couple of significant limits: 400MB per day for data, and three locations only (Amsterdam, New York, Los Angeles).That's not bad, and outperforms the free competition in some areas. Avira's Phantom VPN limits you to 500MB a month, for instance. Avast One's VPN has a generous 5GB a week data allowance, but doesn't support changing locations. ProtonVPN's free offering still wins out for its unlimited data and 12 locations.Opting for a paid plan drops the data and location limits. Prices start at an average $9.99 for monthly billing, and you can pay by card, PayPal and Google Pay. Upgrade to an annual account and the price plummets to just $2.49 a month, while the three-year plan is an amazing $1.39 a month (okay, only for the first term, and it's $3.99 on renewal, but that still looks like a good deal to us).Too good to be true? We'll check that later, but if you sign up and are unhappy, you're protected by a 30-day money-back guarantee.Beware, though: plans automatically renew when you sign up, and there's no way to change this or cancel your account from the control panel. You must email support and ask for help.Atlas VPN has the privacy basics covered with its WireGuard support, AES-256 encryption, kill switch and private DNS system.Unusual extras like rotating IP addresses along with ad and tracker-blocking should bring extra privacy protection.Atlas VPN's own policies aren't as impressive. Access its website for the first time and its cookie disclaimer only has an 'Accept' option, for instance. If you give the company your email address, you're opted in to receive marketing emails unless you specifically say otherwise. And the Blacklight Privacy Inspector found the site used Google Analytics, Facebook and assorted other tracking technologies.(Don't take our or Blacklight's word for it – even Atlas VPN's anti-tracker technology decided it was best to block three trackers on its own website.)Atlas VPN has been through what it calls an independent security audit, but this is just about as limited as we've seen.The exercise only covered the iOS app, for instance. It was a black box review, which means the auditors tested the functionality of the app, but didn't see the source code. And although Atlas VPN quoted some of the results in a blog post, it hasn't published the full report, so there's no way to judge it for ourselves.Okay, this is better than nothing, but only just, and it can't match the best of the competition. TunnelBear has annual audits of its apps, servers and backend infrastructure, for instance, and publishes the results for everyone to see.Atlas VPN claims to have a 'solid no-logs policy', saying 'we do not collect details on our users' activities, DNS queries, or other data that could be linked to our users.'The privacy policy says Atlas VPN's apps collect some device data, though. This includes: 'device type, model, brand name (e.g. Samsung, Apple), OS version, device ID, language, time zone, coarse location (city scale).'It also mentions using 'attribution analytics to track install source and traffic source', and 'advertising IDs to measure performance of our campaigns.'Put it all together and there's nothing to indicate Atlas VPN logs any of your online activities. It does have enough data to build user profiles, though, including details on user devices, when they connect and the amount of data they use. And as Atlas VPN hasn't had its no logging claims audited, there's no independent evidence to tell us if it's living up to its promises.The Windows app is basic, and covers only the VPN fundamentals: a location list of cities, a Connect/Disconnect button, and a handful of settings. (The latter consists of a 'Start on launch' option, an On/Off toggle for the kill switch, and a choice of WireGuard or IKEv2 protocols.)The developer hasn't paid much attention to usability. The location list covers cities, for instance, but they're not grouped by country or sorted in any order we could recognize. ('Germany, Serbia, USA - New Jersey, Hong Kong, Poland, Japan' is a part of the sequence – can you see any pattern?)There's no Favorites system or Recently Used list, either, so changing location is always going to require some scrolling.Our connection attempts failed sometimes with the free Atlas servers, perhaps a sign that they're overloaded. But this wasn't an issue once we upgraded, and connection times were decent at an average 5-6 seconds.Atlas claims its app has malware and ad blocking. There's no sign of this in the app itself, though, and it made no visible difference to us. We saw far better results by installing the free uBlock Origin.Our kill switch tests began with us simulating a dropped VPN. The good news is the kill switch immediately blocked our internet, ensuring we couldn't use the unprotected connection. The bad news – well, where to begin?The app didn't raise an alert when the VPN failed, for instance. It didn't try to reconnect, either. In a real-world situation you might easily waste time checking networks, rebooting your device, or even the router, before you figured out why your internet was down.Usually we could restore normal operations by hitting the Connect button. Sometimes this failed, though, with the app recommending we turned off the kill switch. What, it even blocked its own internet access? Really?We reluctantly agreed to turn the kill switch off, and the app then connected. But when we checked Settings, the kill switch was still marked as on – it hadn't been disabled, after all.Confused? Us too. Overall, the kill switch protected us from dropped connections, and that's what matters most. But the app could do a lot more to keep users informed, and get the VPN up and running again at the maximum possible speed.Desktop VPN apps normally beat their mobile VPN cousins for features, but not here. Atlas VPN's Android app outperforms its Windows offering in several areas.The location list works as expected, for instance, with countries grouped by continent and sorted alphabetically.There's a separate list of Streaming Servers, apparently optimized to reduce buffering, something not included on the desktop build.Settings are essentially the same as Windows, including a kill switch and support for WireGuard and IKEv2 protocols.An Assistant page hosts a tracker blocking feature and the Data Breach Monitor, more options that we couldn't find on Windows. We ran a quick check of these, and found they offered some value. Turning on tracker blocking protected us from some trackers, and entering an email into the Data Breach Monitor listed some of the breaches where our credentials were exposed.Atlas VPN's iOS app also improves on the Windows client with its sensibly sorted location list, tracker blocking and Data Breach Monitor options. It's a little short on features, though, with no WireGuard support or kill switch.Atlas VPN's support website is a little limited, and that's putting it politely. There are very few articles, most don't cover the topics you need, and many of what's left only have a few lines of content.The Troubleshooting section is a great example. We hoped to see some sound general advice on installation problems, issues with app features or download speeds. Instead, we found only four articles on very specific issues, such as 'How to fix error 13801 on Windows?' and 'What if my PC does not support Atlas VPN 64-bit?'(And if you're expecting any depth with the help provided, prepare for disappointment. This is the entire and unedited answer to that last question: 'No need to worry if your Windows device does not support Atlas VPN 64-bit: you can download the 32-bit version here.')Atlas VPN has no live chat support, but you can contact the company via email. We sent a message with a couple of simple product questions. Does the Windows app have tracker blocking? And which, if any of the apps block malicious websites or ads, as none of them mention it anywhere?A reply arrived just over two hours later, not bad for a response time.The message read: 'The mentioned features are currently being tested, therefore they are not available on all platforms. They should be rolled out to other OS'es soon, however, we are unable to provide an exact ETA as it may be misleading.'As Atlas VPN couldn't tell us which apps support malicious website or ad blocking, we'll assume the feature isn't available yet. That might have changed by the time you read this, but if it's a priority for you, ask the company before you sign up.Atlas VPN hadn't always impressed us so far, but it got off to a great unblocking start by getting us into BBC iPlayer.Accessing US Amazon was more difficult than usual, as it asked us to complete a CAPTCHA first. IP reputation service IPQualityScore revealed that our Atlas server IP address had a fraud rating of 100, with recent abuse reported. That's not anything directly to do with Atlas VPN, but it suggests the free plan and low prices might make the company especially appealing to hackers. That makes for more blacklisted IPs, and could mean more CAPTCHAS and other security hassles for you.Once we'd accessed US Amazon Prime, though, Atlas allowed us to stream content right away. We moved on to Disney Plus and were able to access that site, too.US Netflix is the jewel in the unblocking crown, though, and it was out of Atlas VPN's reach. We weren't able to view content from any of Atlas VPN's US servers.We measure VPN performance by running several benchmarking services – SpeedTest's website and command line app, SpeedOf.me, nPerf – from both a UK data center and a US residential location. We run each benchmark five times using WireGuard and OpenVPN (where available), run them a second time several hours later (that's a minimum of 120 tests), then analyze the data to see what's going on.Atlas VPN doesn't support OpenVPN, but its IKEv2 speeds were reasonable at a mid-range 260-320Mpps in the US, 170-210Mbps in the UK.Switching to WireGuard made a big difference, though, with speeds jumping to 590-600Mbps in the UK, and 650-800Mbps in the US. That's not quite a performance leader – NordVPN peaked at 880Mbps, IPVanish at 900Mbps – but it beat names like Windscribe (430-480Mbps), StrongVPN (450Mbps) and Surfshark (450-475Mbps).Atlas VPN may not have the best network, or apps, or support site – for those, you'd have to go for a more established provider like ExpressVPN. But now it's owned by Nord Security, we'd expect to see some improvements. And even right now, Atlas VPN's speeds are good, it unblocks more sites than many, and the three-year plan is as cheap as you'll see anywhere.Mike began his career as a lead software developer in the engineering world, where his creations were used by big-name companies from Rolls Royce to British Nuclear Fuels and British Aerospace.

<title>Calendar.com review | TechRadar</title>
<content>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more By Stefan Ionescu 11 November 2021 Calendar.com is a long-standing name on the market for calendar apps, and its developers have put a lot of effort into making it a good, well-rounded solution. The interface is very light on the eyes and works smoothly, and the app itself offers lots of different features aimed at users with specific needs. It comes in several pricing tiers – including a free one – that allow users to pick the version that best matches their individual preferences. Calendar.com is a long-standing name on the market for calendar apps, and its developers have put a lot of effort into making it a good, well-rounded solution. The interface is very light on the eyes and works smoothly, and the app itself offers lots of different features aimed at users with specific needs. It comes in several pricing tiers – including a free one – that allow users to pick the version that best matches their individual preferences. If you’ve spent some time looking for a good calendar app, you’ve probably noticed that the market tends to be divided into two main categories. On one hand, we have apps aimed at individual users, offering a small but solid set of features that fit most needs. On the other hand, there are also the more advanced, professional calendar apps that offer lots of features and are designed to work best in large organizations.Calendar.com is a little bit of both, with features that can make it an attractive choice for regular home users, while also offering a competent professional package suitable for organizations of different sizes. The app is offered on multiple platforms as well, making it one of the most versatile offers on the market at the moment. Users can easily check out the free version and then upgrade to one of the premium tiers, and it doesn’t take long to set it up on different devices.There are three plans available – Free, Standard ($6/month), and Pro ($8/month). The free plan comes with pretty much everything one might need for regular daily use, and doesn’t lock any critical features behind a paywall, unlike some competing apps. Users on this tier can connect to one calendar on an external platform, and will have one basic workspace to use. It’s worth noting that up to five members can be added to a single workspace, even on a free tier, which makes the app better for collaboration for those who don’t want to pay for a premium solution.The two premium tiers add a variety of extra features aimed primarily at users in organizations. This includes the ability to sync more calendars under a single account, unlimited workspace members, meetings with 25 and even 50 guests, and analytics that can help you gain a deeper understanding of your scheduling habits. Calendar.com comes with all standard features you would expect to find in a modern calendar app. You can view your schedule in different modes – day/week/month/year, and can easily share your calendar with other users, including those on Google services. Free users can set up meetings with up to 5 attendants, and the app offers advanced scheduling options to help you find the best available timeslot.Some of the features offered by Calendar.com can’t be found in other similar apps, or at least not often – such as the ability to embed calendars in web pages, and the native Zapier integration. Zoom integration is available as well, though only on the premium tiers. For most individual users, this shouldn’t matter much, but for those planning to use Calendar.com in an organization, subscribing to one of the premium tiers will be a good idea. The interface of Calendar.com doesn’t shine with anything unusual, but it gets the job done more or less fine. The app leans towards a more minimalistic design, hiding elements that are not used frequently and focusing on the major parts of the interface. That said, you should find it very easy to dig up any feature you might need, and it doesn’t take long to get used to the way the interface is organized.The app does tend to flow a bit better with a premium subscription, mainly because it unlocks its full range of features. The free tier still has its benefits though – especially for those looking for simplicity and a clean design. Some users might find the additional features in the premium tiers confusing, since many of them are aimed at organizations and similar use cases. Give the free version a try before deciding to upgrade to a premium plan, as it might work just fine for your specific needs.The company provides standard email support on top of their help knowledge base, and they additionally offer some special options to premium subscribers. If you’re on the Standard or Pro tier, you can get in touch with support representatives over the phone, and your inquiries will be prioritized. Free users will still get support, but in a more limited capacity. Most of the problems you may encounter during your use of the app should already be covered in the knowledgebase in any case.Calendar.com manages to stand out with its set of features and pricing plans. The app faces direct competition from Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, and other popular solutions like Fantastical. It still has a dedicated user base, and some have been with it for many years at this point. Choosing between Calendar.com and some of its popular competitors is mostly about personal choice with regards to things like interface organization and pricing, and the app is definitely worth checking out if you’re currently comparing the different options on the market.The app does a great job on all fronts, and can be equally useful to individuals as well as large organizations. It takes some time to get used to how it works, but after that, everything is quite easy. The strong support it receives from its developers is nothing but a huge plus as well, so if you’re looking for a good calendar app that covers all important bases at a reasonable price, look no further.We've also featured the best calendar apps and best time management appsStefan has always been a lover of tech.

<title>FastVPN review | TechRadar</title>
<content>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more By Mike Williams 12 November 2021 Seriously cheap for the first year, but you can see why: the desktop apps are unreliable, and there are very features. For unblocking Netflix and basic tasks only.Seriously cheap for the first year, but you can see why: the desktop apps are unreliable, and there are very features. For unblocking Netflix and basic tasks only.FastVPN is a simple VPN owned by Namecheap, the popular domain registrar and web hosting service.If you're wondering why you should trust a domain registrar to run your VPN, good question. No need to worry, though; it's using servers run by an arm of StackPath, which has also provided the network for major VPN brands such as IPVanish and StrongVPN.Whoever owns the network, it's a decent size, with 1,000+ P2P-friendly servers spread across 75+ locations worldwide. Apps are available for Windows, Mac, iOS and Android; tutorials show how to set up the service on Linux and various routers, and, unusually, there are no annoying limits on the number of devices you can connect at one time.The feature list is basic, though, covering the bare essentials only. You get OpenVPN and IKEv2 protocol support (no WireGuard), secure DNS to reduce the chance of DNS leaks, a kill switch to block internet access if the VPN drops, and that's about it.FastVPN's starting prices are some of the lowest around, thanks to big discounts off your first term.Sign up for the monthly plan, for instance, and you'll pay nothing at all for the first month, effectively a 30-day free trial, rising to a still-excellent $5.88 on renewal.The annual plan is just $1 a month for year one, rising to $2.88 on renewal. There are no longer-term plans (the old three-year option has disappeared.)These are very low first-term prices (and they're pretty good on renewal, too). Private Internet Access is one of our go-to VPNs for value, but with monthly plans at $9.95, dropping to $3.33 paid annually, it's still no match for FastVPN.If you are tempted, you're able to by card or PayPal, and there's a 30-day money-back guarantee to protect you if it all goes wrong.The FastVPN website comments briefly on logging, saying you'll "keep your browsing activities to yourself with our strict no-log policy" and that the service "won’t track, collect, or share any of your logs". We searched the website for something more detailed, without any luck. The only extra information we found came from the Windows VPN app installer, which warned that it collected "aggregated anonymous app usage data, including your device and OS version so we can troubleshoot and improve our app", but "that's it", and that there's "no tracking of your personal identifiable information".We'd like a little more substance than that, and ideally a security or no-logging audit, but that doesn't seem likely to happen any time soon. FastVPN is targeted at the average consumer who wants something easy to use which 'just works', and not the kind of user who cares about session logging or whether it uses AES-256-CBC or GCM.FastVPN's Windows app opens with a default 'Best Available' server choice, and a 'Connect VPN' button. The client displays the name of your current network, too, a handy way to be sure you're connecting to the official coffee shop Wi-Fi, and not some shady open network nearby.A location picker to the left gives a list of countries (some with city-level choices), server load and ping time information (you can sort by those, too), simple Favorites system to easily group your most commonly used locations.Although this looked good in theory, real-world performance was poor. OpenVPN connections took up to 40 seconds, three to four times faster than we usually see, and IKEv2 connections were also poor at 18-20 seconds.That was just the start. Occasionally, after connecting, we found we couldn't access any websites. Sometimes the VPN dropped, complaining of various internal errors or that there was 'no network detected.' It didn't help that some of these error messages were layered on top of normal status information, making them difficult to read. Not a huge issue, but it all helps to create a poor impression of the app. We expect better from a big company such as Namecheap.Settings are relatively limited: auto-start options, a choice of protocol (IKEv2, OpenVPN TCP/ UDP, and a Scramble option to help bypass VPN blocking), and a kill switch to block internet access if the VPN drops.The app handled unexpected disconnects very well. We forcibly closed our IKEv2 connection, the app noticed, displayed a notification and reconnected at once. So, we closed the connection again, then kept closing it, as fast we could, interrupting every reconnect attempt. That's a level of stress testing which goes way beyond what you're likely to see in real life, but the app just waited until we'd finished, then reconnected as before.The kill switch generally worked well, too. Whatever we did to IKEv2 or OpenVPN connections, the app raised an alert, wasn't especially troubled by our extreme testing methods and reconnected as soon as it could, without ever leaving us unprotected. FastVPN's Android VPN app looks and feels very similar to the Windows edition: big green Connect button, by default you're connected to the nearest server, but you can choose something else from a searchable list of locations.We noticed small usability issues. The desktop app hides city locations by default, and they're only visible if you expand a specific country. The mobile app displays city and country names in the same list, so there's much more scrolling (and the cities aren't always displayed in alphabetical order, either.) Settings are basic, too, with protocol options reduced to OpenVPN UDP or TCP (no IKEv2, this time).FastVPN's iOS app is very similar, but does add one very useful feature. An Always On option enables automatically connecting to the VPN whenever you access untrusted networks, while also ignoring networks you know are safe (home, work, etc).These apps aren't bad, and they didn't have the technical issues we saw on the desktop. But they're also short on features, and can't begin to compete with the best VPNs.FastVPN doesn't make any specific claims about its website-unblocking abilities, but generally suggests it can help you 'securely unblock sites and content.'This certainly worked as a BBC iPlayer VPN, where FastVPN got us access with the first location we tried.The service scored an even big victory when it unblocked US Netflix, a task which defeats many big VPN names.But FastVPN couldn't keep up that level of success, and it failed with Amazon Prime Video and Disney+.That's not a bad result, but we've seen some providers do much better. CyberGhost, ExpressVPN, Hide.me, Private Internet Access, ProtonVPN and Surfshark all unblocked everything in their latest reviews.We measured FastVPN speeds from a UK data center with excellent connectivity and a 1Gbps connection, giving us room to see exactly what the service could do.FastVPN turned out to be not so fast after all, with both OpenVPN and IKEv2 speeds reaching a modest 250Mbps. That's better than some - NordVPN and IPVanish didn't reach 200Mbps with OpenVPN - but a long way behind OpenVPN leaders such as HideMyAss! (340-350Mbps), Hide.me (390Mbps) and ProtonVPN (400-460Mbps.)There's another problem. OpenVPN is the fastest protocol FastVPN supports, but most providers give you much more capable options. IPVanish's WireGuard connections hit 750-900Mbps in recent reviews, for instance, while NordVPN's NordLynx was a close match at 760-880Mbps.So despite the name, there's no chance this service will appear in our list of the truly fastest VPNs. But although FastVPN trails far behind in the speed stakes, it's also far from the worst we've seen, and the service should handle most browsing or streaming tasks with ease.FastVPN's ultra-low starter prices caught our eye, but the Windows app was unreliable and there are very few features. Could work as a cheap VPN for unblocking Netflix and other basic tasks, but this isn't the service for experienced or demanding users. Assuming you want something better, we'd suggest going for our #1 rated ExpressVPN or, to save on costs, the also brilliant Surfshark.Mike began his career as a lead software developer in the engineering world, where his creations were used by big-name companies from Rolls Royce to British Nuclear Fuels and British Aerospace.

<title>Zoho Recruit review | TechRadar</title>
<content>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more By Mike Jennings 12 November 2021 Zoho Recruit offers excellent features that are easy to use though this recruitment tool can be expensive for smaller businesses.Zoho Recruit offers excellent features that are easy to use though this recruitment tool can be expensive for smaller businesses.Zoho Recruit is one of the biggest Applicant Tracking System (ATS) services in the world, so it’s going to be right at the top of most people’s lists if they need some help with their hunt for top-quality staff.There’s plenty going for Zoho Recruit, including a free option and a broad range of features. Still, we’ve also got questions about some of the firm’s support options and integration abilities.Zoho Recruit has a broad range of features that are divided into three kinds of product – one for companies, another for recruitment agencies and a third for people who need to hire temporary staff.The Corporate HR product allows you to post job openings to hundreds of different mainstream and niche job boards, and you can boost job listings on social networks. You can also search through resumes with AI-powered modules that will find candidates on your behalf. You can set up a dedicated resume inbox and invite recruiters to submit potential candidates through a portal with your own branding. You can also establish an employee referral portal to allow your existing staff to give recommendations.Zoho’s AI features are robust and impressive. Applicants can be graded in advance based on your preferred traits and requirements, and advanced searches help narrow down the candidate pool.You can use Zoho’s background screening module to run background checks so you can adhere to your preferred hiring practices, and you can ask candidates to complete pre-screening assessments to help eliminate unsuitable people and streamline the process.HR staff and candidates can access dedicated portals to track the status of applications, and Zoho allows you to track recruitment stats and analyze data. Thanks to a customized series of alerts, rules, and actions, corporate HR staff can also automate much of the recruitment process. Impressively, Zoho’s entire experience can be customized, from the branding and aesthetic of the software to custom tabs and layout options.Switch over to Zoho’s agency module, and you get the same features alongside options to have powerful client portals that allow agency clients to create vacancies easily, send feedback and invite people to interview. And if you use Zoho’s temporary staff product, you’ll receive help from straightforward and powerful scheduling and timesheet tools alongside electronic signatures and invoicing to speed up laborious parts of the process. Temporary workers can also access their own portal to mark their availability and view their workloads.Zoho does have good features, but some things are missing here too. Zoho Recruit has integrations with Outlook, LinkedIn, Google Suite, and a selection of other products and services, but you’ll find more integration ability elsewhere.This service doesn’t have as many behavioral, skill, and cognitive testing options as some other recruitment services, either. You only get 24/7 support if you pay extra, too – standard plans only have support five days of the week.Zoho’s broader company offers a full range of HR products, which is excellent if you want to pick and choose features or opt for a more comprehensive HR solution. Sadly, though, that means you don’t get onboarding unless you pay more.Zoho’s standard Corporate HR package costs $25 per month if you buy annually, and you get the service’s core features alongside candidate sourcing, resume management, tracking, and Google, Zoho, and Microsoft Outlook integrations. If you buy the $50 per month Enterprise product, you get AI-powered candidate matching, improvement portal management, and advanced customization. On top of that, you’ll need to pay extra for hiring manager and vendor portal licenses.Recruitment agencies can pay for $25, $50, and $75 tiers, with the two latter options adding extra features. That $50 choice adds AI matching, advanced analytics, better security control, portal management, and candidate assessment options. The top-tier service adds more customization and portal options.The temporary employee package has a simple, single price of $59 a month, although you’ll have to pay more if you want to hire more than 25 employees.Zoho Recruit’s three products also have free tiers that give you candidate management, interview scheduling, and simple resume search options alongside other basic features. Still, these options are restrictive – HR departments can only list one vacancy at a time, and the temporary staff package is limited to five people.Zoho Recruit has an impressive selection of features, no matter which package you choose. It doesn’t require a huge amount of technical knowledge to use and excels when it comes to customization and AI-powered extras. It offers a broad slate of recruitment options for HR departments, temporary staff needs, and agencies, and it can be easily incorporated into a wider HR product if necessary.The costs can mount up, especially if you want a full HR or recruitment solution, and you may want to look elsewhere if you need more testing options, extension integration, or better support.For most companies and agencies, though, Zoho Recruit will prove excellent, and is one of the recruitment services you need to consider.We've also featured the best recruitment platforms, best HR software and best background check servicesSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!Thank you for signing up to TechRadar.

<title>iTop VPN | TechRadar</title>
<content>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more By Mike Williams 12 November 2021 iTop VPN's generous 700MB/day (21GB/month) free plan might be worth a look for simple, non-privacy-critical tasks, but the service has too many fundamental issues to justify handing over your cash.iTop VPN's generous 700MB/day (21GB/month) free plan might be worth a look for simple, non-privacy-critical tasks, but the service has too many fundamental issues to justify handing over your cash.iTop VPN is a free VPN service with an affordable paid plan and one or two unusual privacy extras.The free plan gives you 700MB of data per day (21GB per month), and a choice of 16 locations (including the US and UK), easily beating most of the competition.Paying for a subscription gets you access to 100+ locations and 1,800+ streaming and gaming-optimized servers. (P2P is supported, too, though only on a handful of specialist servers.)A longer-than-usual list of bonus features include split tunneling, along with ad, tracker and malware blocking, browser history cleaning, and a Security Reinforce tool checks your device privacy settings and warns of any problems.iTop VPN has apps for Windows, Mac (a recent addition), Android and iOS, and support for connecting up to five devices simultaneously.This VPN's monthly plan is priced at $11.99, not the highest we've seen, but more expensive than most.Paying six months upfront cuts the cost to $6.99 a month, but that's still above average. You're paying iTop $41.94 to get your six months of cover, for instance, but Private Internet Access only asks $39.95 for a full year ($3.33 a month).iTop isn't done yet, though. Opt for its annual plan and you'll get an extra year thrown in, giving you two year's protection for $2.31 a month. A handful of providers are even cheaper – Private Internet Access has a three-year plan for $2.19 a month, Ivacy and PrivadoVPN go even lower – but that still looks like a real bargain.iTop supports payments via card, PayPal and bank transfers. It's good to see that you can turn off auto-renewal when you purchase the service, too, ensuring you won't accidentally pay for a second term that you don't want.Even better, if you're unhappy, a 15-day 'no questions asked' money-back guarantee (7 days for monthly-billed plans) means you're able to get your first payment back, too.Most VPNs protect your privacy by using secure VPN protocols such as WireGuard and OpenVPN. This doesn't guarantee you'll be safe – a provider can easily make mistakes in how they're set up – but they're open source, so anyone can see how they work or check the code for problems.However, iTop uses a custom scheme of its own. The Windows app appears to make a fast proxy connection to the VPN server, then uses an open source package called WinDivert to direct your traffic through the tunnel, apparently encrypting it with iTop's own protocol.Maybe this is secure, maybe it's not, but the company doesn't provide enough information to judge. You can't check the encryption it uses, for instance.We noticed a separate privacy issue on the iTop VPN website. Its SSL certificate wasn't properly configured, and this allowed us to access areas of the site, including the Login page, using an unencrypted HTTP connection. Unless you're using the VPN, that risks exposing your credentials to snoopers.iTop scores another privacy thumbs-down for its order form, where it insisted we entered our full name, city and post or ZIP code. A tooltip tried to justify this by saying that the details 'allow us to contact you if there are any issues with your order.' Uh, isn't that what our email address is for?iTop VPN claims to have a no logging policy, and the privacy policy spells out what this means.The company does its best to sound reassuring, telling users: 'We do not log your activity while you are utilizing the Services, including your browsing history, the bandwidth you used, or how long you connected to VPN servers. We do not store your original IP address or the server IP address that you connect to.'Sounds good, but we already know this can't be entirely true. iTop VPN limits its free plan to 700MB a day, so to make this work it must log the bandwidth you use and associate it with a device ID.Scroll down the page and you'll find a 'What information we collect' section, which could also include a lot of data: '...operating system, device ID, Internet protocol addresses, browser type, browser language, referring/exit pages, clickstream data of our websites and our products or services, and the pages or features of our software or services accessed by you and the time spent there.'Some of that looks like it's referring to the website, not iTop's apps, but the fact that we're left to guess is a problem. A privacy policy should be clear and precise, not leave us with more questions than it answers.Whatever you think of iTop VPN's claims, the real problem here is the company hasn't had them confirmed by any kind of security or logging audit. We're left to take iTop on trust, and hope the firm is delivering what it promises.iTop VPN's apps look good and are stuffed with features, but also score poorly on many of the usability fundamentals.Hitting a big red Connect button should by default automatically connect you to the nearest server, for instance. But even though we were testing from the UK, the free app regularly connected us to Japan, and the paid plan sometimes chose Germany.An 'All Servers' list enables switching to another location, but this also isn't as easy as it should be. For example, the countries aren't sorted by name, continent, distance or any other order we could recognize (there are sequences like Korea, Russia, UK, Italy, Singapore and so on). And there's no Favorites system or Recently Used lists to help out.The app is missing some usability shortcuts we commonly see elsewhere. You can't double click a location name to connect, for instance – you must click a location's Connect button, instead. When the app does connect (or disconnect), there's no notification to alert you, so you won't know whether you're protected unless you keep an eye on the app interface.On the plus side, you get separate Streaming, Social and Gaming lists where you can view locations optimized for specific platforms (PUBG, Warzone, Netflix, Disney Plus, Amazon Prime, iPlayer, Hulu and more).Too much scrolling? The Quick Access pane lists 17 common reasons for using a VPN: Browse Privacy, Hide Location, Watch Netflix, Play PUBG, Unblock WhatsApp (or Telegram, Facebook, Twitter etc), and more. If you're looking to unblock Netflix, there's no need to scan down a lengthy list of servers and try to guess which is best: just tap 'Watch Netflix' and the app automatically chooses a location for you.These work well, and we like the flexibility. But we'd prefer iTop VPN to sort out some of the interface basics before it layers on any more extras.iTop VPN's Mac app mostly looks like the Windows build, but with a few very noticeable changes.There's no Downloading section, for instance – the P2P locations are in the 'All Servers' lists. The Quick Tasks section doesn't have a Play PUBG tile. There's no kill switch and no Settings menu (the Protocols list is now on the main screen). If you regularly use both the Windows and Mac apps, the differences could be a little confusing.The iOS app is all about simplicity, with no Settings menu, no kill switch, no P2P, no HTTPS protocol option, and absolutely no bonus privacy tools. Instead, you just get the location lists, a big Connect button and a choice of TCP/UDP protocols.There's good news in one iOS area. Cities are grouped into countries, making for a shorter and better-organized list. But it's still not sorted alphabetically (and to make it worse, the iOS app uses a different order to the Windows build).The Android app is essentially the iOS version with added split tunneling, and yet another sort order for the servers list. Not a big deal unless you're using iTop VPN on several platforms – only then will you need to remember where your favorite locations appear on each device.iTop VPN supports a kill switch to stop internet traffic if the VPN drops unexpectedly. We found the Windows app was mostly successful, but had some flaws. When we forcibly crashed the app, for instance, our VPN connection dropped, the kill switch didn't kick in, and our traffic was unprotected. And as the app doesn't raise any notifications, an affected user is unlikely to realize they're at risk in such a scenario.Split tunneling support allows you to decide which apps use the tunnel, and which don't. It's handy if you only need the VPN to unblock a couple of websites, say, as other apps can use your normal (and faster) connection. This worked well for us, directing only browsers through the VPN by default, but making it easy to add other apps as required.A DNS Protection feature claims to protect your DNS settings from modification by malware. You can also set your DNS to one of several public DNS providers, simply by choosing them from a list: Google, OpenDNS, Verizon, Comodo and DNS Advantage.The app has a handful of settings. You're able to launch it when Windows starts, optionally connect, and choose one of three protocol options: UDP, TCP and HTTPS. As iTop VPN doesn't use any standard VPN protocol, it's not completely clear what the effects of these settings might be, and the descriptions don't help much. (Choosing TCP apparently gets you 'high level privacy', for instance, while opting for UDP means faster speeds but 'more data usage for special occasions.')iTop VPN is also missing some of the more advanced settings we see with other apps. It won't automatically connect when you access insecure Wi-Fi, for example. There are no leak protection options, and we saw no way to control notifications.iTop VPN has some privacy and security extras that we've not seen with other VPNs.A Security Reinforce module scanned our PC for weak or non-standard security settings, then suggested appropriate changes. You'll need some technical knowledge to understand its report, but the advice looks good to us, and is likely to improve your system security.The Browser Privacy feature can check and clear your browsing tracks in Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Opera and even Internet Explorer.These tools aren't the best we've seen, and they're maybe not all suitable for a VPN. Most providers use their own DNS servers rather than OpenVPN or Google, for instance, as that ensures no one else gets to see the sites you visit.But there's also more power here than we expected. DNS Protection isn't something iTop VPN threw together in an afternoon, for instance – it's an IObit feature taken direct from IObit Malware Fighter. Put it all together and the extras could have some value for more experienced users. (Although, as with the main app interface, we'd be happier if the developer sorted out the core features before starting with piling on the extras.)iTop VPN apps have specialist locations for unblocking many platforms, making them far easier to use than many competitors. If you're looking to unblock a supported platform in the US, say, you don't have to start choosing US locations until you find one that works: just choose a service from the list and you're ready to go.We tried this with BBC iPlayer, often a tricky site to unblock, but iTop VPN got us access right away.iTop VPN has Disney Plus locations in New York and Los Angeles. They both worked for us.There are streaming locations for Amazon Prime in the US and UK, but we weren't so lucky with these. Amazon spotted what we were doing, displayed its 'your device is connected to the internet using a VPN or proxy service' and demanded we 'disable it and try again.'It was the same disappointing story with Netflix: iTop VPN has a couple of specialist Netflix servers (US and Korea) but neither worked for us.Getting us into two of our four test sites isn't bad, but other providers do much better. CyberGhost, ExpressVPN, Hide.me, Hola, PrivadoVPN, Private Internet Access, ProtonVPN and Surfshark all unblocked every one of our test platforms in recent reviews.We measured iTop VPN speeds from US and UK locations with a 1Gbps connection in both cases, using several performance testing sites and services (SpeedTest's website and command line app, nPerf, SpeedOfme and more). We checked the download speeds at least five times from each site, and then we repeated all the tests in an evening session.UK download speeds were very ordinary at 180-190Mbps, but US performance was much better, with peak median speeds of around 360-400Mps, even reaching 900Mbps at one point. We're skeptical about that peak score, as it only happened in a single session out of the 20 we ran in the US, and none of the others got near even half that speed. We think the 360-400Mbps figure is more representative of what you're likely to see.That's not a bad result, and it's a close match with the OpenVPN performance we see from the likes of HideMyAss! (270-410Mbps) and TunnelBear (330-350Mbps).iTop's results lag well behind many other VPNs, though, especially when they're using WireGuard and faster protocols (providers such as CyberGhost, IPVanish and NordVPN regularly hit 750-900Mbps).There's another issue, too. That 330-350Mbps we saw from TunnelBear was using a standard OpenVPN connection with a very well-understood level of encryption and security. But iTop VPN uses the company's own custom protocol, which means we can't be sure these figures are a fair comparison. If iTop VPN is using more basic encryption, for instance, that might give it a big performance advantage, but at the cost of some security.iTop VPN has a stack of powerful extras, but it misses on a lot of the VPN fundamentals: there is no OpenVPN or WireGuard, limited unblocking, a flawed kill switch, plus various privacy issues. Its 700MB per day (21GB a month) free plan might be worth considering, but we wouldn't use it for anything privacy-critical.Mike began his career as a lead software developer in the engineering world, where his creations were used by big-name companies from Rolls Royce to British Nuclear Fuels and British Aerospace.

<title>Workable review | TechRadar</title>
<content>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more By Mike Jennings 12 November 2021 While Workable provides plenty of features for recruitment, many rivals go a bit further with their respective offerings.While Workable provides plenty of features for recruitment, many rivals go a bit further with their respective offerings.Workable is a dedicated recruitment platform and Applicant Tracking System and it doesn’t tie into a wider suite of HR products, so it’s got a focused and well-designed range of features.It’s not the cheapest recruitment solution around, though, so it’s going to have to impress if businesses are going to find room for Workable in their budgets.Workable’s features are divided into three strands – the first sources and attracts candidates, the second handles evaluation and interviews, and the third tackles hiring.Workable has one-click job posting to more than 200 job boards, and it integrates with your company’s social media channels so you can advertise your own vacancies. You can also use Workable’s own drag-and-drop system to build your corporate careers page, and job applications from various sources are collated into a single pipeline for easier management.Lots of the processes can be automated, too. Workable’s AI systems supply a list of up to 50 potential candidates when you post a new job – you don’t even have to wait for the resumes to roll in. This service can automatically create social adverts for your positions, and Workable’s Chrome extension can deliver in-depth candidate information based on their social media profiles.Recruiters can also use Workable’s powerful Boolean search options to find suitable candidates. Workable has internal application options and an employee referral platform that can include unique sharing links and referral rewards.Switch over to the evaluation and interview module, and you’ll find more helpful features. You can use more than 700 job description templates that are SEO-optimized, and you can customize your hiring pipeline for consistency and familiarity.The service supports two-way syncing with Gmail and Outlook accounts to help recruiters and candidates stay on the same page, and Workable has an app to allow staff to manage recruitment on the move. Elsewhere, you’ll find collaborative tools that can be used by your whole HR team and in-built support for video interviews, and you can automate candidate communication. Anonymized candidate screening enables more inclusive hiring, and you can assess candidates using skillset, personality, and cognitive ability tests – and then see all the data so you can make informed hiring decisions.Further automation streamlines the hiring process, and you can use a central workflow and timeline to keep staff abreast of hiring processes and budgets. Workable has built-in offer letters and electronic signatures, and Workable also supports national, international, and local regulations to help your company be fully compliant.Workable also integrates with software from Microsoft, Google, Facebook, and LinkedIn, and can also be used with HR tools from Glassdoor, Bamboo, and Indeed. Ultimately, there are dozens of third-party integrations here for products that handle video interviews, assessments, referrals, sourcing, and every other part of the recruitment process.Workable does have a broad range of features, but large companies may want more customization and abilities from an HR product that handles more than just the recruitment process. Workable also misses out on automated reference checking, and it doesn’t have any onboarding options beyond the ability to offer jobs to candidates.Workable’s software is divided into four different products. The Paygo option costs $99 per job posted per month, and it has Workable’s essential features but few of the advanced options – it’s billed as a self-service choice for companies that only hire occasionally.The Core, Growth, and Premier options supply added functionality – the Core option builds on the PayGo service, the Growth tier adds automation options and extra features alongside a dedicated account manager, and the Premier option unlocks every feature alongside bespoke onboarding for the service in your business.Workable doesn’t list the pricing for those three products, though. You’ll have to get in touch with the company and work out costs based on your company’s size and needs.Workable is a straightforward recruitment tool with a good range of features that deliver a well-balanced approach across the entire recruitment process.It’s particularly useful for small and medium-sized businesses who need recruitment software to integrate with other HR services they may use. Still, larger companies with their own HR staff or full-service third-party options may not find this dedicated product necessary.We've also featured the best recruitment platforms, best HR software and best background check servicesSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!Thank you for signing up to TechRadar.

<title>Host Europe web hosting review | TechRadar</title>
<content>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more By Mike Williams , Mirza Bahic 12 November 2021 Host Europe is a strong, stable, and feature-packed web hosting provider geared towards German-speaking customers. If you fall into this category, don’t hesitate to give them a chance.Host Europe is a strong, stable, and feature-packed web hosting provider geared towards German-speaking customers. If you fall into this category, don’t hesitate to give them a chance.Established in 1997 in Germany, Host Europe has become and remained rather successful since, continuing to offer web hosting solutions for individuals, small and medium-sized businesses. They say that their primary objective is to provide their customers with internet and server hosting with the highest quality possible. This rings true if we consider that they’ve collected more than a couple of rewards throughout the years.In the Readers' Choice Host Europe was voted as the best service provider of 2019, the second-best in 2020, and a second-best in the cloud hosting category. They were also awarded gold three times at the Hosting & Service Provider Summits and received other awards by HOSTtest.de and from the test portal CHIP for best-in-class accessibility.Host Europe was one among the brands of HEG (Host Europe Group), a web hosting, email, and domain name registrar giant founded in 1997, same as its subsidiary. In December 2016, HEG was acquired by GoDaddy, and its name is slowly being phased out if the news holds true. However, this shouldn’t impact Host Europe in any significant way.Host Europe is headquartered in Cologne and has two “energy-saving and secure” data centers in Cologne and Strasbourg. If you wish to find out more about these two, the “Technology” section on their website provides plenty of information on the matter.The official site of Host Europe looks and feels old-fashioned, although not necessarily in a bad way since it makes finding your way around rather simple. The site is available in German and English language and it features a good-looking blog, which, unfortunately, isn’t translated into English.You can find Host Europe on Facebook (which is in English although the articles linked there are often in German), and Twitter (which is openly exclusive to its German-speaking followers). Host Europe's solutions include shared hosting, WordPress hosting, ecommerce hosting, VPS, reseller hosting, and dedicated server hosting, as well as domain name registration, SSL certificates, backup storage, site security, Microsoft 365 tools, professional email, and a website builder.Although Host Europe's hosting plans are affordable in general, which of them you get to choose from depends on whether you want to pay on a monthly or an annual basis. The price is identical but if you want to commit for one month only you’ll also have to pay a €14.99 ($17.30) one-off setup fee.Regardless of the billing cycle, for €4.99 ($5.75) per month, the “Basic” plan will supply you with one annual domain, SSL, 50GB of storage space, two MySQL databases, one automated mailbox migration (included in the first 30 days), and Kaspersky virus protection. More expensive plans won’t add further features but increase the amount of storage space, the number of databases, and the number of antivirus software solutions.While Host Europe doesn’t offer a money-back guarantee, you can cancel your contract with them within four weeks.As for payment methods, Host Europe accepts all major credit cards, PayPal, and SEPA direct debit. To create an account with Host Europe you’ll have to provide your full name, phone number, email, and physical address, and think up a strong password. Here, you can choose whether you want to be contacted via email, phone, or both. Depending on your choice, you’ll receive an order confirmation via message or email together, containing extremely detailed explanations of the features you can expect to receive, the cancellation policy, and the General Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy.After adding your payment details and making a purchase, you’ll be transferred to Host Europe’s dashboard, which (unfortunately for non-German users) suffers from an incomplete translation to English. To be fair, most important information is fully translated to English, but there are still parts in German, including the FAQ section accessible through the dashboard.Since Host Europe is not the swiftest of providers, you may have to hang around for a while before finding out whether your order was accepted or not. If yes, you’ll still have to provide additional information about your order before you can start using the product you've purchased. As of late, Host Europe provides user-friendly cPanel with its Linux-based products, and Plesk is available with the Windows hosting packages - the two most popular control panels in the industry. As for website building, in addition to a whole variety of CMS options (WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, and so on), ecommerce apps (Magento, Blestan, OpenCart, and more), community building tools (phpBB, Booked, Dada Mail, and so forth) and other useful apps you can easily install via Installatron, you’ll also get a bare-bones version of a beginner-friendly website builder. To get more of everything (sites, webspace per site, templates, email accounts, and so forth) you’ll have to purchase one of the bigger website builder plans as an add-on. After putting Host Europe’s official site to the GTmetrix speed test, we got average results altogether. The time it took for the site to fully load was an amazing 1.3 seconds but all other vital speed measuring metrics (largest contentful paint, total blocking time, and cumulative layout shift) got trapped in the abyss of averageness pulling the final score down to B (74%).When it comes to uptime, Host Europe guarantees an availability of its data centers at 99.95% as a monthly mean, with the exclusion of scheduled (and unscheduled) maintenance windows. This can be translated into 4.5 hours of downtime annually, or about 10 minutes for two weeks.After monitoring the uptime of Host Europe's official site via UptimeRobot for two weeks, we recorded a worrying 55 minutes of downtime which dragged the total uptime to 99.76%, meaning that we should be getting some sweet credit as compensation.If you find yourself in need of a helping hand, you can try reaching Host Europe's team via email, fax, live chat, and, if you’re in a rush, around-the-clock telephone number. The toll-free numbers are available for users from Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, as well as the “order hotline” which is reachable Monday to Friday, from 9 AM to 5 PM. There is even Host Europe's postal address if you feel like writing them an old-fashioned letter and recalling the “old days”. Alternatively, you can browse their “Forms and documents” section for questions related to terms of service, and it is available both in English and German. There is also a well-equipped FAQ section (it’s closer to a knowledge base), but it still isn’t translated into English, which means all users who don’t understand German are left to fend for themselves. Unfortunately, there is no community forum as a final resort before reaching the support personnel. If you want a well-rounded host that will give you more than enough time to decide whether you want to stay with them or part your ways, HostGator may be worth a look. Besides offering an ample 45-day money-back guarantee, it is also geared towards English-speaking users making itself more attractive to an international market than Host Europe.Another US-based alternative to Host Europe is Bluehost, a host that is known for its pocket-friendly pricing and not particularly pocket-friendly price spike after the promotional period. Although with Host Europe there is a one-off setup fee with all monthly plans, at least you won’t have to worry about any sudden price spikes.If you are looking for a simple solution from Germany aimed at personal sites or small businesses, a Berlin-based Strato might be worth a try. Although their scope of hosting solution seems somewhat limited, all their plans support multiple-domain hosting, come with a free domain, a free SSL certificate, plenty of one-click installs, a website builder, and a 30-day “no quibble” money-back guarantee. Unlike Host Europe, Strato doesn’t offer a monthly billing option, although the one you get with Host Europe will set you back with a one-off setup fee.Hostinger is one of the most popular hosts from Europe. It offers its users an access to its servers which are found all around the world including the Americas, Europe, and Asia. Thanks to its 14-day “observation” period you can try out everything for yourselves without a need to worry about your budget. Unfortunately, you will not get such a chance with Host Europe.Host Europe is an award-winning veteran from Germany trusted by over 250.000 customers as we write, and the number keeps on growing. If you can come to terms with data centers in Germany and France (kind of), self-help options being in German only, somewhat sluggish sign-up procedure, and considerable one-off setup fees (with monthly plans), be sure to give Host Europe a chance. If not, HostGator or Bluehost might be a better choice. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!Thank you for signing up to TechRadar.

<title>Atlas VPN review | TechRadar</title>
<content>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more By Mike Williams 12 November 2021 Atlas VPN misses in some areas with its underpowered apps and feeble support site, but there's also plenty to like – it's P2P friendly, with great WireGuard-powered download speeds and no device limits for a very, very low price. Factor in the experience it'll gain after being acquired by NordVPN, and we think Atlas only gets better from.Atlas VPN misses in some areas with its underpowered apps and feeble support site, but there's also plenty to like – it's P2P friendly, with great WireGuard-powered download speeds and no device limits for a very, very low price. Factor in the experience it'll gain after being acquired by NordVPN, and we think Atlas only gets better from.Atlas VPN is a capable VPN provider which offers a decent all-round service for some of the lowest prices around.There's support for the speedy WireGuard protocol, for instance. You get apps for Windows, Mac, iOS and Android, a kill switch to protect you if the VPN drops, and the service allows unlimited simultaneous connections.A SafeSwap feature changes your IP address regularly while you're connected to the same server, maximizing your anonymity.Bonus features include ad and malware blocking, while data breach monitoring alerts you if any of your personal details are found on the dark web.Atlas VPN's network is smaller than many, with 700 servers spread across 27 countries. It'll be enough for many users, though, and P2P is supported everywhere.The really interesting news here came in October 2021, when Nord Security (the company behind NordVPN) announced it had acquired Atlas VPN. That tells you, all on its own, that Atlas isn't just another identikit VPN provider: there's some substance here, something worth buying. And although Atlas VPN will continue as an independent provider, it'll surely benefit in future from Nord Security's resources and experience.Atlas VPN's free no-registration-required plan gives you an easy way to try out the service, though with a couple of significant limits: 400MB per day for data, and three locations only (Amsterdam, New York, Los Angeles).That's not bad, and outperforms the free competition in some areas. Avira's Phantom VPN limits you to 500MB a month, for instance. Avast One's VPN has a generous 5GB a week data allowance, but doesn't support changing locations. ProtonVPN's free offering still wins out for its unlimited data and 12 locations.Opting for a paid plan drops the data and location limits. Prices start at an average $9.99 for monthly billing, and you can pay by card, PayPal and Google Pay. Upgrade to an annual account and the price plummets to just $2.49 a month, while the three-year plan is an amazing $1.39 a month (okay, only for the first term, and it's $3.99 on renewal, but that still looks like a good deal to us).Too good to be true? We'll check that later, but if you sign up and are unhappy, you're protected by a 30-day money-back guarantee.Beware, though: plans automatically renew when you sign up, and there's no way to change this or cancel your account from the control panel. You must email support and ask for help.Atlas VPN has the privacy basics covered with its WireGuard support, AES-256 encryption, kill switch and private DNS system.Unusual extras like rotating IP addresses along with ad and tracker-blocking should bring extra privacy protection.Atlas VPN's own policies aren't as impressive. Access its website for the first time and its cookie disclaimer only has an 'Accept' option, for instance. If you give the company your email address, you're opted in to receive marketing emails unless you specifically say otherwise. And the Blacklight Privacy Inspector found the site used Google Analytics, Facebook and assorted other tracking technologies.(Don't take our or Blacklight's word for it – even Atlas VPN's anti-tracker technology decided it was best to block three trackers on its own website.)Atlas VPN has been through what it calls an independent security audit, but this is just about as limited as we've seen.The exercise only covered the iOS app, for instance. It was a black box review, which means the auditors tested the functionality of the app, but didn't see the source code. And although Atlas VPN quoted some of the results in a blog post, it hasn't published the full report, so there's no way to judge it for ourselves.Okay, this is better than nothing, but only just, and it can't match the best of the competition. TunnelBear has annual audits of its apps, servers and backend infrastructure, for instance, and publishes the results for everyone to see.Atlas VPN claims to have a 'solid no-logs policy', saying 'we do not collect details on our users' activities, DNS queries, or other data that could be linked to our users.'The privacy policy says Atlas VPN's apps collect some device data, though. This includes: 'device type, model, brand name (e.g. Samsung, Apple), OS version, device ID, language, time zone, coarse location (city scale).'It also mentions using 'attribution analytics to track install source and traffic source', and 'advertising IDs to measure performance of our campaigns.'Put it all together and there's nothing to indicate Atlas VPN logs any of your online activities. It does have enough data to build user profiles, though, including details on user devices, when they connect and the amount of data they use. And as Atlas VPN hasn't had its no logging claims audited, there's no independent evidence to tell us if it's living up to its promises.The Windows app is basic, and covers only the VPN fundamentals: a location list of cities, a Connect/Disconnect button, and a handful of settings. (The latter consists of a 'Start on launch' option, an On/Off toggle for the kill switch, and a choice of WireGuard or IKEv2 protocols.)The developer hasn't paid much attention to usability. The location list covers cities, for instance, but they're not grouped by country or sorted in any order we could recognize. ('Germany, Serbia, USA - New Jersey, Hong Kong, Poland, Japan' is a part of the sequence – can you see any pattern?)There's no Favorites system or Recently Used list, either, so changing location is always going to require some scrolling.Our connection attempts failed sometimes with the free Atlas servers, perhaps a sign that they're overloaded. But this wasn't an issue once we upgraded, and connection times were decent at an average 5-6 seconds.Atlas claims its app has malware and ad blocking. There's no sign of this in the app itself, though, and it made no visible difference to us. We saw far better results by installing the free uBlock Origin.Our kill switch tests began with us simulating a dropped VPN. The good news is the kill switch immediately blocked our internet, ensuring we couldn't use the unprotected connection. The bad news – well, where to begin?The app didn't raise an alert when the VPN failed, for instance. It didn't try to reconnect, either. In a real-world situation you might easily waste time checking networks, rebooting your device, or even the router, before you figured out why your internet was down.Usually we could restore normal operations by hitting the Connect button. Sometimes this failed, though, with the app recommending we turned off the kill switch. What, it even blocked its own internet access? Really?We reluctantly agreed to turn the kill switch off, and the app then connected. But when we checked Settings, the kill switch was still marked as on – it hadn't been disabled, after all.Confused? Us too. Overall, the kill switch protected us from dropped connections, and that's what matters most. But the app could do a lot more to keep users informed, and get the VPN up and running again at the maximum possible speed.Desktop VPN apps normally beat their mobile VPN cousins for features, but not here. Atlas VPN's Android app outperforms its Windows offering in several areas.The location list works as expected, for instance, with countries grouped by continent and sorted alphabetically.There's a separate list of Streaming Servers, apparently optimized to reduce buffering, something not included on the desktop build.Settings are essentially the same as Windows, including a kill switch and support for WireGuard and IKEv2 protocols.An Assistant page hosts a tracker blocking feature and the Data Breach Monitor, more options that we couldn't find on Windows. We ran a quick check of these, and found they offered some value. Turning on tracker blocking protected us from some trackers, and entering an email into the Data Breach Monitor listed some of the breaches where our credentials were exposed.Atlas VPN's iOS app also improves on the Windows client with its sensibly sorted location list, tracker blocking and Data Breach Monitor options. It's a little short on features, though, with no WireGuard support or kill switch.Atlas VPN's support website is a little limited, and that's putting it politely. There are very few articles, most don't cover the topics you need, and many of what's left only have a few lines of content.The Troubleshooting section is a great example. We hoped to see some sound general advice on installation problems, issues with app features or download speeds. Instead, we found only four articles on very specific issues, such as 'How to fix error 13801 on Windows?' and 'What if my PC does not support Atlas VPN 64-bit?'(And if you're expecting any depth with the help provided, prepare for disappointment. This is the entire and unedited answer to that last question: 'No need to worry if your Windows device does not support Atlas VPN 64-bit: you can download the 32-bit version here.')Atlas VPN has no live chat support, but you can contact the company via email. We sent a message with a couple of simple product questions. Does the Windows app have tracker blocking? And which, if any of the apps block malicious websites or ads, as none of them mention it anywhere?A reply arrived just over two hours later, not bad for a response time.The message read: 'The mentioned features are currently being tested, therefore they are not available on all platforms. They should be rolled out to other OS'es soon, however, we are unable to provide an exact ETA as it may be misleading.'As Atlas VPN couldn't tell us which apps support malicious website or ad blocking, we'll assume the feature isn't available yet. That might have changed by the time you read this, but if it's a priority for you, ask the company before you sign up.Atlas VPN hadn't always impressed us so far, but it got off to a great unblocking start by getting us into BBC iPlayer.Accessing US Amazon was more difficult than usual, as it asked us to complete a CAPTCHA first. IP reputation service IPQualityScore revealed that our Atlas server IP address had a fraud rating of 100, with recent abuse reported. That's not anything directly to do with Atlas VPN, but it suggests the free plan and low prices might make the company especially appealing to hackers. That makes for more blacklisted IPs, and could mean more CAPTCHAS and other security hassles for you.Once we'd accessed US Amazon Prime, though, Atlas allowed us to stream content right away. We moved on to Disney Plus and were able to access that site, too.US Netflix is the jewel in the unblocking crown, though, and it was out of Atlas VPN's reach. We weren't able to view content from any of Atlas VPN's US servers.We measure VPN performance by running several benchmarking services – SpeedTest's website and command line app, SpeedOf.me, nPerf – from both a UK data center and a US residential location. We run each benchmark five times using WireGuard and OpenVPN (where available), run them a second time several hours later (that's a minimum of 120 tests), then analyze the data to see what's going on.Atlas VPN doesn't support OpenVPN, but its IKEv2 speeds were reasonable at a mid-range 260-320Mpps in the US, 170-210Mbps in the UK.Switching to WireGuard made a big difference, though, with speeds jumping to 590-600Mbps in the UK, and 650-800Mbps in the US. That's not quite a performance leader – NordVPN peaked at 880Mbps, IPVanish at 900Mbps – but it beat names like Windscribe (430-480Mbps), StrongVPN (450Mbps) and Surfshark (450-475Mbps).Atlas VPN may not have the best network, or apps, or support site – for those, you'd have to go for a more established provider like ExpressVPN. But now it's owned by Nord Security, we'd expect to see some improvements. And even right now, Atlas VPN's speeds are good, it unblocks more sites than many, and the three-year plan is as cheap as you'll see anywhere.Mike began his career as a lead software developer in the engineering world, where his creations were used by big-name companies from Rolls Royce to British Nuclear Fuels and British Aerospace.

<title>Calendar.com review | TechRadar</title>

Learn more By Stefan Ionescu 11 November 2021 Calendar.com is a long-standing name on the market for calendar apps, and its developers have put a lot of effort into making it a good, well-rounded solution. The interface is very light on the eyes and works smoothly, and the app itself offers lots of different features aimed at users with specific needs. It comes in several pricing tiers – including a free one – that allow users to pick the version that best matches their individual preferences. Calendar.com is a long-standing name on the market for calendar apps, and its developers have put a lot of effort into making it a good, well-rounded solution. The interface is very light on the eyes and works smoothly, and the app itself offers lots of different features aimed at users with specific needs. It comes in several pricing tiers – including a free one – that allow users to pick the version that best matches their individual preferences. If you’ve spent some time looking for a good calendar app, you’ve probably noticed that the market tends to be divided into two main categories. On one hand, we have apps aimed at individual users, offering a small but solid set of features that fit most needs. On the other hand, there are also the more advanced, professional calendar apps that offer lots of features and are designed to work best in large organizations.Calendar.com is a little bit of both, with features that can make it an attractive choice for regular home users, while also offering a competent professional package suitable for organizations of different sizes. The app is offered on multiple platforms as well, making it one of the most versatile offers on the market at the moment. Users can easily check out the free version and then upgrade to one of the premium tiers, and it doesn’t take long to set it up on different devices.There are three plans available – Free, Standard ($6/month), and Pro ($8/month). The free plan comes with pretty much everything one might need for regular daily use, and doesn’t lock any critical features behind a paywall, unlike some competing apps. Users on this tier can connect to one calendar on an external platform, and will have one basic workspace to use. It’s worth noting that up to five members can be added to a single workspace, even on a free tier, which makes the app better for collaboration for those who don’t want to pay for a premium solution.The two premium tiers add a variety of extra features aimed primarily at users in organizations. This includes the ability to sync more calendars under a single account, unlimited workspace members, meetings with 25 and even 50 guests, and analytics that can help you gain a deeper understanding of your scheduling habits. Calendar.com comes with all standard features you would expect to find in a modern calendar app. You can view your schedule in different modes – day/week/month/year, and can easily share your calendar with other users, including those on Google services. Free users can set up meetings with up to 5 attendants, and the app offers advanced scheduling options to help you find the best available timeslot.Some of the features offered by Calendar.com can’t be found in other similar apps, or at least not often – such as the ability to embed calendars in web pages, and the native Zapier integration. Zoom integration is available as well, though only on the premium tiers. For most individual users, this shouldn’t matter much, but for those planning to use Calendar.com in an organization, subscribing to one of the premium tiers will be a good idea. The interface of Calendar.com doesn’t shine with anything unusual, but it gets the job done more or less fine. The app leans towards a more minimalistic design, hiding elements that are not used frequently and focusing on the major parts of the interface. That said, you should find it very easy to dig up any feature you might need, and it doesn’t take long to get used to the way the interface is organized.The app does tend to flow a bit better with a premium subscription, mainly because it unlocks its full range of features. The free tier still has its benefits though – especially for those looking for simplicity and a clean design. Some users might find the additional features in the premium tiers confusing, since many of them are aimed at organizations and similar use cases. Give the free version a try before deciding to upgrade to a premium plan, as it might work just fine for your specific needs.The company provides standard email support on top of their help knowledge base, and they additionally offer some special options to premium subscribers. If you’re on the Standard or Pro tier, you can get in touch with support representatives over the phone, and your inquiries will be prioritized. Free users will still get support, but in a more limited capacity. Most of the problems you may encounter during your use of the app should already be covered in the knowledgebase in any case.Calendar.com manages to stand out with its set of features and pricing plans. The app faces direct competition from Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, and other popular solutions like Fantastical. It still has a dedicated user base, and some have been with it for many years at this point. Choosing between Calendar.com and some of its popular competitors is mostly about personal choice with regards to things like interface organization and pricing, and the app is definitely worth checking out if you’re currently comparing the different options on the market.The app does a great job on all fronts, and can be equally useful to individuals as well as large organizations. It takes some time to get used to how it works, but after that, everything is quite easy. The strong support it receives from its developers is nothing but a huge plus as well, so if you’re looking for a good calendar app that covers all important bases at a reasonable price, look no further.We've also featured the best calendar apps and best time management appsStefan has always been a lover of tech.

<title>FastVPN review | TechRadar</title>
<content>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more By Mike Williams 12 November 2021 Seriously cheap for the first year, but you can see why: the desktop apps are unreliable, and there are very features. For unblocking Netflix and basic tasks only.Seriously cheap for the first year, but you can see why: the desktop apps are unreliable, and there are very features. For unblocking Netflix and basic tasks only.FastVPN is a simple VPN owned by Namecheap, the popular domain registrar and web hosting service.If you're wondering why you should trust a domain registrar to run your VPN, good question. No need to worry, though; it's using servers run by an arm of StackPath, which has also provided the network for major VPN brands such as IPVanish and StrongVPN.Whoever owns the network, it's a decent size, with 1,000+ P2P-friendly servers spread across 75+ locations worldwide. Apps are available for Windows, Mac, iOS and Android; tutorials show how to set up the service on Linux and various routers, and, unusually, there are no annoying limits on the number of devices you can connect at one time.The feature list is basic, though, covering the bare essentials only. You get OpenVPN and IKEv2 protocol support (no WireGuard), secure DNS to reduce the chance of DNS leaks, a kill switch to block internet access if the VPN drops, and that's about it.FastVPN's starting prices are some of the lowest around, thanks to big discounts off your first term.Sign up for the monthly plan, for instance, and you'll pay nothing at all for the first month, effectively a 30-day free trial, rising to a still-excellent $5.88 on renewal.The annual plan is just $1 a month for year one, rising to $2.88 on renewal. There are no longer-term plans (the old three-year option has disappeared.)These are very low first-term prices (and they're pretty good on renewal, too). Private Internet Access is one of our go-to VPNs for value, but with monthly plans at $9.95, dropping to $3.33 paid annually, it's still no match for FastVPN.If you are tempted, you're able to by card or PayPal, and there's a 30-day money-back guarantee to protect you if it all goes wrong.The FastVPN website comments briefly on logging, saying you'll "keep your browsing activities to yourself with our strict no-log policy" and that the service "won’t track, collect, or share any of your logs". We searched the website for something more detailed, without any luck. The only extra information we found came from the Windows VPN app installer, which warned that it collected "aggregated anonymous app usage data, including your device and OS version so we can troubleshoot and improve our app", but "that's it", and that there's "no tracking of your personal identifiable information".We'd like a little more substance than that, and ideally a security or no-logging audit, but that doesn't seem likely to happen any time soon. FastVPN is targeted at the average consumer who wants something easy to use which 'just works', and not the kind of user who cares about session logging or whether it uses AES-256-CBC or GCM.FastVPN's Windows app opens with a default 'Best Available' server choice, and a 'Connect VPN' button. The client displays the name of your current network, too, a handy way to be sure you're connecting to the official coffee shop Wi-Fi, and not some shady open network nearby.A location picker to the left gives a list of countries (some with city-level choices), server load and ping time information (you can sort by those, too), simple Favorites system to easily group your most commonly used locations.Although this looked good in theory, real-world performance was poor. OpenVPN connections took up to 40 seconds, three to four times faster than we usually see, and IKEv2 connections were also poor at 18-20 seconds.That was just the start. Occasionally, after connecting, we found we couldn't access any websites. Sometimes the VPN dropped, complaining of various internal errors or that there was 'no network detected.' It didn't help that some of these error messages were layered on top of normal status information, making them difficult to read. Not a huge issue, but it all helps to create a poor impression of the app. We expect better from a big company such as Namecheap.Settings are relatively limited: auto-start options, a choice of protocol (IKEv2, OpenVPN TCP/ UDP, and a Scramble option to help bypass VPN blocking), and a kill switch to block internet access if the VPN drops.The app handled unexpected disconnects very well. We forcibly closed our IKEv2 connection, the app noticed, displayed a notification and reconnected at once. So, we closed the connection again, then kept closing it, as fast we could, interrupting every reconnect attempt. That's a level of stress testing which goes way beyond what you're likely to see in real life, but the app just waited until we'd finished, then reconnected as before.The kill switch generally worked well, too. Whatever we did to IKEv2 or OpenVPN connections, the app raised an alert, wasn't especially troubled by our extreme testing methods and reconnected as soon as it could, without ever leaving us unprotected. FastVPN's Android VPN app looks and feels very similar to the Windows edition: big green Connect button, by default you're connected to the nearest server, but you can choose something else from a searchable list of locations.We noticed small usability issues. The desktop app hides city locations by default, and they're only visible if you expand a specific country. The mobile app displays city and country names in the same list, so there's much more scrolling (and the cities aren't always displayed in alphabetical order, either.) Settings are basic, too, with protocol options reduced to OpenVPN UDP or TCP (no IKEv2, this time).FastVPN's iOS app is very similar, but does add one very useful feature. An Always On option enables automatically connecting to the VPN whenever you access untrusted networks, while also ignoring networks you know are safe (home, work, etc).These apps aren't bad, and they didn't have the technical issues we saw on the desktop. But they're also short on features, and can't begin to compete with the best VPNs.FastVPN doesn't make any specific claims about its website-unblocking abilities, but generally suggests it can help you 'securely unblock sites and content.'This certainly worked as a BBC iPlayer VPN, where FastVPN got us access with the first location we tried.The service scored an even big victory when it unblocked US Netflix, a task which defeats many big VPN names.But FastVPN couldn't keep up that level of success, and it failed with Amazon Prime Video and Disney+.That's not a bad result, but we've seen some providers do much better. CyberGhost, ExpressVPN, Hide.me, Private Internet Access, ProtonVPN and Surfshark all unblocked everything in their latest reviews.We measured FastVPN speeds from a UK data center with excellent connectivity and a 1Gbps connection, giving us room to see exactly what the service could do.FastVPN turned out to be not so fast after all, with both OpenVPN and IKEv2 speeds reaching a modest 250Mbps. That's better than some - NordVPN and IPVanish didn't reach 200Mbps with OpenVPN - but a long way behind OpenVPN leaders such as HideMyAss! (340-350Mbps), Hide.me (390Mbps) and ProtonVPN (400-460Mbps.)There's another problem. OpenVPN is the fastest protocol FastVPN supports, but most providers give you much more capable options. IPVanish's WireGuard connections hit 750-900Mbps in recent reviews, for instance, while NordVPN's NordLynx was a close match at 760-880Mbps.So despite the name, there's no chance this service will appear in our list of the truly fastest VPNs. But although FastVPN trails far behind in the speed stakes, it's also far from the worst we've seen, and the service should handle most browsing or streaming tasks with ease.FastVPN's ultra-low starter prices caught our eye, but the Windows app was unreliable and there are very few features. Could work as a cheap VPN for unblocking Netflix and other basic tasks, but this isn't the service for experienced or demanding users. Assuming you want something better, we'd suggest going for our #1 rated ExpressVPN or, to save on costs, the also brilliant Surfshark.Mike began his career as a lead software developer in the engineering world, where his creations were used by big-name companies from Rolls Royce to British Nuclear Fuels and British Aerospace.

<title>Zoho Recruit review | TechRadar</title>
<content>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more By Mike Jennings 12 November 2021 Zoho Recruit offers excellent features that are easy to use though this recruitment tool can be expensive for smaller businesses.Zoho Recruit offers excellent features that are easy to use though this recruitment tool can be expensive for smaller businesses.Zoho Recruit is one of the biggest Applicant Tracking System (ATS) services in the world, so it’s going to be right at the top of most people’s lists if they need some help with their hunt for top-quality staff.There’s plenty going for Zoho Recruit, including a free option and a broad range of features. Still, we’ve also got questions about some of the firm’s support options and integration abilities.Zoho Recruit has a broad range of features that are divided into three kinds of product – one for companies, another for recruitment agencies and a third for people who need to hire temporary staff.The Corporate HR product allows you to post job openings to hundreds of different mainstream and niche job boards, and you can boost job listings on social networks. You can also search through resumes with AI-powered modules that will find candidates on your behalf. You can set up a dedicated resume inbox and invite recruiters to submit potential candidates through a portal with your own branding. You can also establish an employee referral portal to allow your existing staff to give recommendations.Zoho’s AI features are robust and impressive. Applicants can be graded in advance based on your preferred traits and requirements, and advanced searches help narrow down the candidate pool.You can use Zoho’s background screening module to run background checks so you can adhere to your preferred hiring practices, and you can ask candidates to complete pre-screening assessments to help eliminate unsuitable people and streamline the process.HR staff and candidates can access dedicated portals to track the status of applications, and Zoho allows you to track recruitment stats and analyze data. Thanks to a customized series of alerts, rules, and actions, corporate HR staff can also automate much of the recruitment process. Impressively, Zoho’s entire experience can be customized, from the branding and aesthetic of the software to custom tabs and layout options.Switch over to Zoho’s agency module, and you get the same features alongside options to have powerful client portals that allow agency clients to create vacancies easily, send feedback and invite people to interview. And if you use Zoho’s temporary staff product, you’ll receive help from straightforward and powerful scheduling and timesheet tools alongside electronic signatures and invoicing to speed up laborious parts of the process. Temporary workers can also access their own portal to mark their availability and view their workloads.Zoho does have good features, but some things are missing here too. Zoho Recruit has integrations with Outlook, LinkedIn, Google Suite, and a selection of other products and services, but you’ll find more integration ability elsewhere.This service doesn’t have as many behavioral, skill, and cognitive testing options as some other recruitment services, either. You only get 24/7 support if you pay extra, too – standard plans only have support five days of the week.Zoho’s broader company offers a full range of HR products, which is excellent if you want to pick and choose features or opt for a more comprehensive HR solution. Sadly, though, that means you don’t get onboarding unless you pay more.Zoho’s standard Corporate HR package costs $25 per month if you buy annually, and you get the service’s core features alongside candidate sourcing, resume management, tracking, and Google, Zoho, and Microsoft Outlook integrations. If you buy the $50 per month Enterprise product, you get AI-powered candidate matching, improvement portal management, and advanced customization. On top of that, you’ll need to pay extra for hiring manager and vendor portal licenses.Recruitment agencies can pay for $25, $50, and $75 tiers, with the two latter options adding extra features. That $50 choice adds AI matching, advanced analytics, better security control, portal management, and candidate assessment options. The top-tier service adds more customization and portal options.The temporary employee package has a simple, single price of $59 a month, although you’ll have to pay more if you want to hire more than 25 employees.Zoho Recruit’s three products also have free tiers that give you candidate management, interview scheduling, and simple resume search options alongside other basic features. Still, these options are restrictive – HR departments can only list one vacancy at a time, and the temporary staff package is limited to five people.Zoho Recruit has an impressive selection of features, no matter which package you choose. It doesn’t require a huge amount of technical knowledge to use and excels when it comes to customization and AI-powered extras. It offers a broad slate of recruitment options for HR departments, temporary staff needs, and agencies, and it can be easily incorporated into a wider HR product if necessary.The costs can mount up, especially if you want a full HR or recruitment solution, and you may want to look elsewhere if you need more testing options, extension integration, or better support.For most companies and agencies, though, Zoho Recruit will prove excellent, and is one of the recruitment services you need to consider.We've also featured the best recruitment platforms, best HR software and best background check servicesSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!Thank you for signing up to TechRadar.

<title>iTop VPN | TechRadar</title>
<content>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more By Mike Williams 12 November 2021 iTop VPN's generous 700MB/day (21GB/month) free plan might be worth a look for simple, non-privacy-critical tasks, but the service has too many fundamental issues to justify handing over your cash.iTop VPN's generous 700MB/day (21GB/month) free plan might be worth a look for simple, non-privacy-critical tasks, but the service has too many fundamental issues to justify handing over your cash.iTop VPN is a free VPN service with an affordable paid plan and one or two unusual privacy extras.The free plan gives you 700MB of data per day (21GB per month), and a choice of 16 locations (including the US and UK), easily beating most of the competition.Paying for a subscription gets you access to 100+ locations and 1,800+ streaming and gaming-optimized servers. (P2P is supported, too, though only on a handful of specialist servers.)A longer-than-usual list of bonus features include split tunneling, along with ad, tracker and malware blocking, browser history cleaning, and a Security Reinforce tool checks your device privacy settings and warns of any problems.iTop VPN has apps for Windows, Mac (a recent addition), Android and iOS, and support for connecting up to five devices simultaneously.This VPN's monthly plan is priced at $11.99, not the highest we've seen, but more expensive than most.Paying six months upfront cuts the cost to $6.99 a month, but that's still above average. You're paying iTop $41.94 to get your six months of cover, for instance, but Private Internet Access only asks $39.95 for a full year ($3.33 a month).iTop isn't done yet, though. Opt for its annual plan and you'll get an extra year thrown in, giving you two year's protection for $2.31 a month. A handful of providers are even cheaper – Private Internet Access has a three-year plan for $2.19 a month, Ivacy and PrivadoVPN go even lower – but that still looks like a real bargain.iTop supports payments via card, PayPal and bank transfers. It's good to see that you can turn off auto-renewal when you purchase the service, too, ensuring you won't accidentally pay for a second term that you don't want.Even better, if you're unhappy, a 15-day 'no questions asked' money-back guarantee (7 days for monthly-billed plans) means you're able to get your first payment back, too.Most VPNs protect your privacy by using secure VPN protocols such as WireGuard and OpenVPN. This doesn't guarantee you'll be safe – a provider can easily make mistakes in how they're set up – but they're open source, so anyone can see how they work or check the code for problems.However, iTop uses a custom scheme of its own. The Windows app appears to make a fast proxy connection to the VPN server, then uses an open source package called WinDivert to direct your traffic through the tunnel, apparently encrypting it with iTop's own protocol.Maybe this is secure, maybe it's not, but the company doesn't provide enough information to judge. You can't check the encryption it uses, for instance.We noticed a separate privacy issue on the iTop VPN website. Its SSL certificate wasn't properly configured, and this allowed us to access areas of the site, including the Login page, using an unencrypted HTTP connection. Unless you're using the VPN, that risks exposing your credentials to snoopers.iTop scores another privacy thumbs-down for its order form, where it insisted we entered our full name, city and post or ZIP code. A tooltip tried to justify this by saying that the details 'allow us to contact you if there are any issues with your order.' Uh, isn't that what our email address is for?iTop VPN claims to have a no logging policy, and the privacy policy spells out what this means.The company does its best to sound reassuring, telling users: 'We do not log your activity while you are utilizing the Services, including your browsing history, the bandwidth you used, or how long you connected to VPN servers. We do not store your original IP address or the server IP address that you connect to.'Sounds good, but we already know this can't be entirely true. iTop VPN limits its free plan to 700MB a day, so to make this work it must log the bandwidth you use and associate it with a device ID.Scroll down the page and you'll find a 'What information we collect' section, which could also include a lot of data: '...operating system, device ID, Internet protocol addresses, browser type, browser language, referring/exit pages, clickstream data of our websites and our products or services, and the pages or features of our software or services accessed by you and the time spent there.'Some of that looks like it's referring to the website, not iTop's apps, but the fact that we're left to guess is a problem. A privacy policy should be clear and precise, not leave us with more questions than it answers.Whatever you think of iTop VPN's claims, the real problem here is the company hasn't had them confirmed by any kind of security or logging audit. We're left to take iTop on trust, and hope the firm is delivering what it promises.iTop VPN's apps look good and are stuffed with features, but also score poorly on many of the usability fundamentals.Hitting a big red Connect button should by default automatically connect you to the nearest server, for instance. But even though we were testing from the UK, the free app regularly connected us to Japan, and the paid plan sometimes chose Germany.An 'All Servers' list enables switching to another location, but this also isn't as easy as it should be. For example, the countries aren't sorted by name, continent, distance or any other order we could recognize (there are sequences like Korea, Russia, UK, Italy, Singapore and so on). And there's no Favorites system or Recently Used lists to help out.The app is missing some usability shortcuts we commonly see elsewhere. You can't double click a location name to connect, for instance – you must click a location's Connect button, instead. When the app does connect (or disconnect), there's no notification to alert you, so you won't know whether you're protected unless you keep an eye on the app interface.On the plus side, you get separate Streaming, Social and Gaming lists where you can view locations optimized for specific platforms (PUBG, Warzone, Netflix, Disney Plus, Amazon Prime, iPlayer, Hulu and more).Too much scrolling? The Quick Access pane lists 17 common reasons for using a VPN: Browse Privacy, Hide Location, Watch Netflix, Play PUBG, Unblock WhatsApp (or Telegram, Facebook, Twitter etc), and more. If you're looking to unblock Netflix, there's no need to scan down a lengthy list of servers and try to guess which is best: just tap 'Watch Netflix' and the app automatically chooses a location for you.These work well, and we like the flexibility. But we'd prefer iTop VPN to sort out some of the interface basics before it layers on any more extras.iTop VPN's Mac app mostly looks like the Windows build, but with a few very noticeable changes.There's no Downloading section, for instance – the P2P locations are in the 'All Servers' lists. The Quick Tasks section doesn't have a Play PUBG tile. There's no kill switch and no Settings menu (the Protocols list is now on the main screen). If you regularly use both the Windows and Mac apps, the differences could be a little confusing.The iOS app is all about simplicity, with no Settings menu, no kill switch, no P2P, no HTTPS protocol option, and absolutely no bonus privacy tools. Instead, you just get the location lists, a big Connect button and a choice of TCP/UDP protocols.There's good news in one iOS area. Cities are grouped into countries, making for a shorter and better-organized list. But it's still not sorted alphabetically (and to make it worse, the iOS app uses a different order to the Windows build).The Android app is essentially the iOS version with added split tunneling, and yet another sort order for the servers list. Not a big deal unless you're using iTop VPN on several platforms – only then will you need to remember where your favorite locations appear on each device.iTop VPN supports a kill switch to stop internet traffic if the VPN drops unexpectedly. We found the Windows app was mostly successful, but had some flaws. When we forcibly crashed the app, for instance, our VPN connection dropped, the kill switch didn't kick in, and our traffic was unprotected. And as the app doesn't raise any notifications, an affected user is unlikely to realize they're at risk in such a scenario.Split tunneling support allows you to decide which apps use the tunnel, and which don't. It's handy if you only need the VPN to unblock a couple of websites, say, as other apps can use your normal (and faster) connection. This worked well for us, directing only browsers through the VPN by default, but making it easy to add other apps as required.A DNS Protection feature claims to protect your DNS settings from modification by malware. You can also set your DNS to one of several public DNS providers, simply by choosing them from a list: Google, OpenDNS, Verizon, Comodo and DNS Advantage.The app has a handful of settings. You're able to launch it when Windows starts, optionally connect, and choose one of three protocol options: UDP, TCP and HTTPS. As iTop VPN doesn't use any standard VPN protocol, it's not completely clear what the effects of these settings might be, and the descriptions don't help much. (Choosing TCP apparently gets you 'high level privacy', for instance, while opting for UDP means faster speeds but 'more data usage for special occasions.')iTop VPN is also missing some of the more advanced settings we see with other apps. It won't automatically connect when you access insecure Wi-Fi, for example. There are no leak protection options, and we saw no way to control notifications.iTop VPN has some privacy and security extras that we've not seen with other VPNs.A Security Reinforce module scanned our PC for weak or non-standard security settings, then suggested appropriate changes. You'll need some technical knowledge to understand its report, but the advice looks good to us, and is likely to improve your system security.The Browser Privacy feature can check and clear your browsing tracks in Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Opera and even Internet Explorer.These tools aren't the best we've seen, and they're maybe not all suitable for a VPN. Most providers use their own DNS servers rather than OpenVPN or Google, for instance, as that ensures no one else gets to see the sites you visit.But there's also more power here than we expected. DNS Protection isn't something iTop VPN threw together in an afternoon, for instance – it's an IObit feature taken direct from IObit Malware Fighter. Put it all together and the extras could have some value for more experienced users. (Although, as with the main app interface, we'd be happier if the developer sorted out the core features before starting with piling on the extras.)iTop VPN apps have specialist locations for unblocking many platforms, making them far easier to use than many competitors. If you're looking to unblock a supported platform in the US, say, you don't have to start choosing US locations until you find one that works: just choose a service from the list and you're ready to go.We tried this with BBC iPlayer, often a tricky site to unblock, but iTop VPN got us access right away.iTop VPN has Disney Plus locations in New York and Los Angeles. They both worked for us.There are streaming locations for Amazon Prime in the US and UK, but we weren't so lucky with these. Amazon spotted what we were doing, displayed its 'your device is connected to the internet using a VPN or proxy service' and demanded we 'disable it and try again.'It was the same disappointing story with Netflix: iTop VPN has a couple of specialist Netflix servers (US and Korea) but neither worked for us.Getting us into two of our four test sites isn't bad, but other providers do much better. CyberGhost, ExpressVPN, Hide.me, Hola, PrivadoVPN, Private Internet Access, ProtonVPN and Surfshark all unblocked every one of our test platforms in recent reviews.We measured iTop VPN speeds from US and UK locations with a 1Gbps connection in both cases, using several performance testing sites and services (SpeedTest's website and command line app, nPerf, SpeedOfme and more). We checked the download speeds at least five times from each site, and then we repeated all the tests in an evening session.UK download speeds were very ordinary at 180-190Mbps, but US performance was much better, with peak median speeds of around 360-400Mps, even reaching 900Mbps at one point. We're skeptical about that peak score, as it only happened in a single session out of the 20 we ran in the US, and none of the others got near even half that speed. We think the 360-400Mbps figure is more representative of what you're likely to see.That's not a bad result, and it's a close match with the OpenVPN performance we see from the likes of HideMyAss! (270-410Mbps) and TunnelBear (330-350Mbps).iTop's results lag well behind many other VPNs, though, especially when they're using WireGuard and faster protocols (providers such as CyberGhost, IPVanish and NordVPN regularly hit 750-900Mbps).There's another issue, too. That 330-350Mbps we saw from TunnelBear was using a standard OpenVPN connection with a very well-understood level of encryption and security. But iTop VPN uses the company's own custom protocol, which means we can't be sure these figures are a fair comparison. If iTop VPN is using more basic encryption, for instance, that might give it a big performance advantage, but at the cost of some security.iTop VPN has a stack of powerful extras, but it misses on a lot of the VPN fundamentals: there is no OpenVPN or WireGuard, limited unblocking, a flawed kill switch, plus various privacy issues. Its 700MB per day (21GB a month) free plan might be worth considering, but we wouldn't use it for anything privacy-critical.Mike began his career as a lead software developer in the engineering world, where his creations were used by big-name companies from Rolls Royce to British Nuclear Fuels and British Aerospace.

<title>Hurry! Apple's 2021 iPad crashes to record-low price ahead of Black Friday | TechRadar</title>
<content>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more By Mackenzie Frazier 13 November 2021 Snag this epic Black Friday iPad deal before it's too lateIf you're wanting to score an early Black Friday deal on Apple's all-new 10.2-inch iPad - then today is your lucky day.

<title>Workable review | TechRadar</title>
<content>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more By Mike Jennings 12 November 2021 While Workable provides plenty of features for recruitment, many rivals go a bit further with their respective offerings.While Workable provides plenty of features for recruitment, many rivals go a bit further with their respective offerings.Workable is a dedicated recruitment platform and Applicant Tracking System and it doesn’t tie into a wider suite of HR products, so it’s got a focused and well-designed range of features.It’s not the cheapest recruitment solution around, though, so it’s going to have to impress if businesses are going to find room for Workable in their budgets.Workable’s features are divided into three strands – the first sources and attracts candidates, the second handles evaluation and interviews, and the third tackles hiring.Workable has one-click job posting to more than 200 job boards, and it integrates with your company’s social media channels so you can advertise your own vacancies. You can also use Workable’s own drag-and-drop system to build your corporate careers page, and job applications from various sources are collated into a single pipeline for easier management.Lots of the processes can be automated, too. Workable’s AI systems supply a list of up to 50 potential candidates when you post a new job – you don’t even have to wait for the resumes to roll in. This service can automatically create social adverts for your positions, and Workable’s Chrome extension can deliver in-depth candidate information based on their social media profiles.Recruiters can also use Workable’s powerful Boolean search options to find suitable candidates. Workable has internal application options and an employee referral platform that can include unique sharing links and referral rewards.Switch over to the evaluation and interview module, and you’ll find more helpful features. You can use more than 700 job description templates that are SEO-optimized, and you can customize your hiring pipeline for consistency and familiarity.The service supports two-way syncing with Gmail and Outlook accounts to help recruiters and candidates stay on the same page, and Workable has an app to allow staff to manage recruitment on the move. Elsewhere, you’ll find collaborative tools that can be used by your whole HR team and in-built support for video interviews, and you can automate candidate communication. Anonymized candidate screening enables more inclusive hiring, and you can assess candidates using skillset, personality, and cognitive ability tests – and then see all the data so you can make informed hiring decisions.Further automation streamlines the hiring process, and you can use a central workflow and timeline to keep staff abreast of hiring processes and budgets. Workable has built-in offer letters and electronic signatures, and Workable also supports national, international, and local regulations to help your company be fully compliant.Workable also integrates with software from Microsoft, Google, Facebook, and LinkedIn, and can also be used with HR tools from Glassdoor, Bamboo, and Indeed. Ultimately, there are dozens of third-party integrations here for products that handle video interviews, assessments, referrals, sourcing, and every other part of the recruitment process.Workable does have a broad range of features, but large companies may want more customization and abilities from an HR product that handles more than just the recruitment process. Workable also misses out on automated reference checking, and it doesn’t have any onboarding options beyond the ability to offer jobs to candidates.Workable’s software is divided into four different products. The Paygo option costs $99 per job posted per month, and it has Workable’s essential features but few of the advanced options – it’s billed as a self-service choice for companies that only hire occasionally.The Core, Growth, and Premier options supply added functionality – the Core option builds on the PayGo service, the Growth tier adds automation options and extra features alongside a dedicated account manager, and the Premier option unlocks every feature alongside bespoke onboarding for the service in your business.Workable doesn’t list the pricing for those three products, though. You’ll have to get in touch with the company and work out costs based on your company’s size and needs.Workable is a straightforward recruitment tool with a good range of features that deliver a well-balanced approach across the entire recruitment process.It’s particularly useful for small and medium-sized businesses who need recruitment software to integrate with other HR services they may use. Still, larger companies with their own HR staff or full-service third-party options may not find this dedicated product necessary.We've also featured the best recruitment platforms, best HR software and best background check servicesSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!Thank you for signing up to TechRadar.

<title>Host Europe web hosting review | TechRadar</title>
<content>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more By Mike Williams , Mirza Bahic 12 November 2021 Host Europe is a strong, stable, and feature-packed web hosting provider geared towards German-speaking customers. If you fall into this category, don’t hesitate to give them a chance.Host Europe is a strong, stable, and feature-packed web hosting provider geared towards German-speaking customers. If you fall into this category, don’t hesitate to give them a chance.Established in 1997 in Germany, Host Europe has become and remained rather successful since, continuing to offer web hosting solutions for individuals, small and medium-sized businesses. They say that their primary objective is to provide their customers with internet and server hosting with the highest quality possible. This rings true if we consider that they’ve collected more than a couple of rewards throughout the years.In the Readers' Choice Host Europe was voted as the best service provider of 2019, the second-best in 2020, and a second-best in the cloud hosting category. They were also awarded gold three times at the Hosting & Service Provider Summits and received other awards by HOSTtest.de and from the test portal CHIP for best-in-class accessibility.Host Europe was one among the brands of HEG (Host Europe Group), a web hosting, email, and domain name registrar giant founded in 1997, same as its subsidiary. In December 2016, HEG was acquired by GoDaddy, and its name is slowly being phased out if the news holds true. However, this shouldn’t impact Host Europe in any significant way.Host Europe is headquartered in Cologne and has two “energy-saving and secure” data centers in Cologne and Strasbourg. If you wish to find out more about these two, the “Technology” section on their website provides plenty of information on the matter.The official site of Host Europe looks and feels old-fashioned, although not necessarily in a bad way since it makes finding your way around rather simple. The site is available in German and English language and it features a good-looking blog, which, unfortunately, isn’t translated into English.You can find Host Europe on Facebook (which is in English although the articles linked there are often in German), and Twitter (which is openly exclusive to its German-speaking followers). Host Europe's solutions include shared hosting, WordPress hosting, ecommerce hosting, VPS, reseller hosting, and dedicated server hosting, as well as domain name registration, SSL certificates, backup storage, site security, Microsoft 365 tools, professional email, and a website builder.Although Host Europe's hosting plans are affordable in general, which of them you get to choose from depends on whether you want to pay on a monthly or an annual basis. The price is identical but if you want to commit for one month only you’ll also have to pay a €14.99 ($17.30) one-off setup fee.Regardless of the billing cycle, for €4.99 ($5.75) per month, the “Basic” plan will supply you with one annual domain, SSL, 50GB of storage space, two MySQL databases, one automated mailbox migration (included in the first 30 days), and Kaspersky virus protection. More expensive plans won’t add further features but increase the amount of storage space, the number of databases, and the number of antivirus software solutions.While Host Europe doesn’t offer a money-back guarantee, you can cancel your contract with them within four weeks.As for payment methods, Host Europe accepts all major credit cards, PayPal, and SEPA direct debit. To create an account with Host Europe you’ll have to provide your full name, phone number, email, and physical address, and think up a strong password. Here, you can choose whether you want to be contacted via email, phone, or both. Depending on your choice, you’ll receive an order confirmation via message or email together, containing extremely detailed explanations of the features you can expect to receive, the cancellation policy, and the General Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy.After adding your payment details and making a purchase, you’ll be transferred to Host Europe’s dashboard, which (unfortunately for non-German users) suffers from an incomplete translation to English. To be fair, most important information is fully translated to English, but there are still parts in German, including the FAQ section accessible through the dashboard.Since Host Europe is not the swiftest of providers, you may have to hang around for a while before finding out whether your order was accepted or not. If yes, you’ll still have to provide additional information about your order before you can start using the product you've purchased. As of late, Host Europe provides user-friendly cPanel with its Linux-based products, and Plesk is available with the Windows hosting packages - the two most popular control panels in the industry. As for website building, in addition to a whole variety of CMS options (WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, and so on), ecommerce apps (Magento, Blestan, OpenCart, and more), community building tools (phpBB, Booked, Dada Mail, and so forth) and other useful apps you can easily install via Installatron, you’ll also get a bare-bones version of a beginner-friendly website builder. To get more of everything (sites, webspace per site, templates, email accounts, and so forth) you’ll have to purchase one of the bigger website builder plans as an add-on. After putting Host Europe’s official site to the GTmetrix speed test, we got average results altogether. The time it took for the site to fully load was an amazing 1.3 seconds but all other vital speed measuring metrics (largest contentful paint, total blocking time, and cumulative layout shift) got trapped in the abyss of averageness pulling the final score down to B (74%).When it comes to uptime, Host Europe guarantees an availability of its data centers at 99.95% as a monthly mean, with the exclusion of scheduled (and unscheduled) maintenance windows. This can be translated into 4.5 hours of downtime annually, or about 10 minutes for two weeks.After monitoring the uptime of Host Europe's official site via UptimeRobot for two weeks, we recorded a worrying 55 minutes of downtime which dragged the total uptime to 99.76%, meaning that we should be getting some sweet credit as compensation.If you find yourself in need of a helping hand, you can try reaching Host Europe's team via email, fax, live chat, and, if you’re in a rush, around-the-clock telephone number. The toll-free numbers are available for users from Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, as well as the “order hotline” which is reachable Monday to Friday, from 9 AM to 5 PM. There is even Host Europe's postal address if you feel like writing them an old-fashioned letter and recalling the “old days”. Alternatively, you can browse their “Forms and documents” section for questions related to terms of service, and it is available both in English and German. There is also a well-equipped FAQ section (it’s closer to a knowledge base), but it still isn’t translated into English, which means all users who don’t understand German are left to fend for themselves. Unfortunately, there is no community forum as a final resort before reaching the support personnel. If you want a well-rounded host that will give you more than enough time to decide whether you want to stay with them or part your ways, HostGator may be worth a look. Besides offering an ample 45-day money-back guarantee, it is also geared towards English-speaking users making itself more attractive to an international market than Host Europe.Another US-based alternative to Host Europe is Bluehost, a host that is known for its pocket-friendly pricing and not particularly pocket-friendly price spike after the promotional period. Although with Host Europe there is a one-off setup fee with all monthly plans, at least you won’t have to worry about any sudden price spikes.If you are looking for a simple solution from Germany aimed at personal sites or small businesses, a Berlin-based Strato might be worth a try. Although their scope of hosting solution seems somewhat limited, all their plans support multiple-domain hosting, come with a free domain, a free SSL certificate, plenty of one-click installs, a website builder, and a 30-day “no quibble” money-back guarantee. Unlike Host Europe, Strato doesn’t offer a monthly billing option, although the one you get with Host Europe will set you back with a one-off setup fee.Hostinger is one of the most popular hosts from Europe. It offers its users an access to its servers which are found all around the world including the Americas, Europe, and Asia. Thanks to its 14-day “observation” period you can try out everything for yourselves without a need to worry about your budget. Unfortunately, you will not get such a chance with Host Europe.Host Europe is an award-winning veteran from Germany trusted by over 250.000 customers as we write, and the number keeps on growing. If you can come to terms with data centers in Germany and France (kind of), self-help options being in German only, somewhat sluggish sign-up procedure, and considerable one-off setup fees (with monthly plans), be sure to give Host Europe a chance. If not, HostGator or Bluehost might be a better choice. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!Thank you for signing up to TechRadar.
