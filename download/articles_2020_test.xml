Learn moreBy Jess Weatherbed 26 October 2021Despite the well-established compatibility issuesMicrosoft has started to roll out a fresh update for Windows 10 that will preload the divisive PC Health Check app onto your device via the latest Windows Update (KB5005463) , mentioning that the update won’t be pushed out to people already using the new operating system.This app is used to quickly inform users if their device meets the requirements to upgrade to the new Windows 11 OS, but given the strict system requirements needed to run it, many laptops and desktops are ineligible, despite some of them running seriously beefy components.OnMST reports that the app will automatically update itself, rather than make you keep it up to date manually, which is a small blessing – but for users who are fully aware their system isn’t eligible to run the new OS (or had no plans to upgrade regardless), this could be seen as an unnecessary nuisance.Thankfully though, this update is completely optional, so you can ignore it or prevent your system from downloading it if you're signed up for automatic system updates. Having the PC Health Check tool on your system won’t do any harm, but it’s reasonable that some folks won’t want any unnecessary programs on their devices.“This update installs the PC Health Check application onto Windows 10, version 2004 and later devices. However, we will not install PC Health Check on Windows 11 devices. PC Health Check includes diagnostics to monitor device health and troubleshooting to improve performance, all from the convenience of a single dashboard,” the company explained on the support page.Despite Microsoft's statement, we anticipate that prompts to upgrade will start to get intrusive over the coming months or years. After all, if the PC Health Check tool was only being pushed to "monitor device health and troubleshooting to improve performance" then surely Windows 11 would also see some benefit from having it?There are good reasons why people are in no rush to upgrade to Windows 11, with cases of computers using AMD Ryzen processors seeing a drop in gaming performance , and perfectly usable devices without a TPM 2.0 (Trusted Platform Module) component installed unable to meet the strict system requirements put in place by Microsoft to boost security.Irrespective of whether avoiding upgrading is willful or due to incompatible hardware, there shouldn’t be any need to rush to upgrade to Windows 11, as Windows 10 will be supported until 2025 . That said, Microsoft is known for being pushy when it comes to people using its products (as anyone who doesn’t use the Edge browser can attest), so a tool that was designed to check Windows 11 compatibility being rolled out across current Windows 10 devices isn’t filling us with confidence.Optional or not, we anticipate that Microsoft will adopt firmer tactics to make Windows 10 users upgrade over the next few years before support for the older OS is dropped, and for good reason. It’s in the company's best interests to move its customers over to this new, more secure operating system even if a small minority of that user base is stubborn.Jess is TechRadar's Computing writer, covering hardware, PC gaming and peripherals.

<p>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn moreBy Daryl Baxter 25 October 2021This is where the fun beginsRunning Android apps in Windows 11 through Amazon was brought to the Insider program last week, and already a developer has unlocked Google’s Play Store for you to run any apps on Microsoft’s operating system instead.While you can currently run apps from Amazon’s Android Store, you were limited to what was available on there, compared to the thousands of apps on Google’s store.From games to productivity tools, and other social media apps, there’s thousands to choose from to run on your laptop or tablet, thanks to a guide that the developer has released over the weekend.However, the benefits of what a larger app store could bring to Windows 11 may show greater opportunities to both Microsoft and Google in the future if users embrace Android on their Windows 11 devices.A developer by the name of ADeltaX on Twitter has been documenting their efforts in getting the Play Store to work, and over the weekend they achieved it.The YouTube tutorial they give is easy to follow, and you’ll be able to run your Android apps alongside Paint, Snipping Tool and other Windows 11 apps in no time.But we should state that this may not be available for long, as Microsoft will most likely revoke access to the store. Currently, the only way to use Android apps will be through the Microsoft Store and the library of Amazon’s App Store.However, this does open up the avenue for games and productivity apps to be used on tablets and laptops alike running Windows 11 that aren’t available through Amazon.It’s no secret that the Google Play Store is less regulated than Apple’s App Store when it comes to the types of apps available to install. From emulators that can run consoles from years ago, to ports of games that are unauthorized by the teams behind the originals.Being able to run these on your Windows 11 device is going to be a tempting prospect to many. There’s around 60,000 apps available on Amazon’s Store, compared to over three million apps on the Google Play Store. With games, media apps and other categories available to download compared to what’s on Amazon’s store, it may tip the scales as to what users want to install on their machine.pic.twitter.com/c8ZxkmdJ4R October 22, 2021But it could also bring an added benefit where Microsoft and Google partner up and make this method official in the future. Microsoft’s CEO, Satya Nadella has been a big proponent of making Windows and the company’s other apps as a service on other devices, so this only makes sense.Especially when the Surface Duo 2 is running Android, there’s no obvious disadvantage here for both companies.However, it may be a question of waiting to see how users around the world will react to Android apps in the Microsoft Store, and if there will be enough of a positive reception for a partnership to occur.But regardless, it’s an interesting time to see the worlds of Microsoft and Google collide. It will ultimately be up to users if they want to see more of their favorite Android apps on Windows 11 devices soon.Via Windows LatestDaryl had been freelancing for 3 years before joining TechRadar, now reporting on everything software-related.

<p>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn moreBy Matt Swider 23 October 2021Exclusive details: We reported on the GameStop PS5 restock on Friday, October 22, and we knew a lot more information about this rare in-store restock event (only the third in-person PS5 restock event in the US during 2021).Follow our PS5 restock tracker Matt Swider – follow and turn on notifications for live in-stock alerts – because there's so much information, in fact, we've chosen to do a GameStop PS5 restock live blog – and we updated the PS5 news all day long.When is the next GameStop PS5 restock? What time will it restock? Which GameStop store locations? How many PS5 consoles are in stock? What are the games in the bundle? And what are the crowd sizes like? Is it worth lining up?We answered all of those questions in the live blog.When? Follow PS5 restock tracker Matt Swider and turn on notifications to get alerts when PS5 is in stock at all US stores: Target, Best Buy, Walmart and, of course, GameStop.Have questions? Drop Matt Swider a line on TwitterOur GameStop PS5 restock live blog started with good news: you had an excellent chance to get the Sony console today – if you live in one of these seven cities in the US.Here's a recap of everything that happened.The last time there was an in-store PS5 restock event in the US, it was at GameStop nearly one month ago (Friday, September 29). These in-person events are rare ; most times we see PS5 for sale online.There have been three PS5 restock in-store events so far in 2021 – besides the two at GameStop in the last 23 days ago, Best Buy also had a restock on September 23. Our inside sources say Walmart is holding back PS5 console inventory for Black Friday 2021 .We're back reporting live from the second GameStop restock event – and third overall in the US.It varies greatly and sometimes GameStop stores in major city centers see fewer people waiting overnight. In suburbs, there are more people, though, rules sometimes prevent camping for consoles (and other wares) at malls. In those cases, it's a scramble when security allows you to line up at sunrise.We interviewed a mom and son who waited in GameStop's line in New York City for nearly three days to be first in line to get the console during the September 29 PS5 console drop. They also took a bus from Baltimore to be there.On the tail end of that same 43-person line – that's how much inventory there was at most locations – was a man who showed up just 30 minutes before GameStop opened at 8am EDT (he had just gotten off an overnight shift at work and was out of breath) was the last to get a PS5 console that day.It's risky to wait that long, as we have reports people are already lining up at some GameStop locations. We're going to go back at 6am, which we feel is a good time for lines in sleepy cities. For other GameStop locations, this may be too late.And we're off to Boston, one of seven cities (and their surrounding areas) to have the PS5 in stock today, Friday, October 22. There are 290 GameStop stores due to have the Sony console in the morning (whenever they normally open is the time).In fact, our GameStop PS5 restock store locations page has all 290 addresses listed, something GameStop's own database didn't even get right.How will the crowds be in Boston? What about Chicago from Matt Swider's Twitter followers checking in? This is where our GameStop PS5 restock live blog is really going to get interesting.Why Boston for us? It has stores that open up at 8am EDT, meaning we'll be the first to report on the PS5 restock inventory on Friday morning.This took a long time to put together, as even GameStop had the PS5 restock store locations addresses wrong. We fixed their errors.Los Angeles was one of the first places we began to hear would have the PS5 for Friday. Sure enough, the sources were right and the City of Angles will indeed have Playstation 5 bundles on hand, first-come, first-serve.Store name: Glendale Galleria Store address: 3216 Glendale Galleria,

This photo was taken at 11:30pm EDT and there was no one in line except for Matt Swider and restock tracker/ YouTuber Jake Randall .One of the reasons for the lack of crowds? GameStop forces people to buy bundles, so the resellers stay home. That's good news for actual gamers, but expect to pay something like $740 today (we know this because GameStop had an online restock on Tuesday with the same bundle contents).More good news to start out PS5 restock live blog. There are plenty of consoles at the locations we've checked: 60 PS5 Disc consoles in total.And the bundle is actually a good one: the PS5 Disc console, Ghost of Tsushima, Far Cry 6, a $50 GameStop gift card and a 12-month membership to PlayStation Plus. We've confirmed that it'll cost $740, which is face value for everything.But that on-the-ground reporting is what counts: 60 consoles and no one in line at midnight. You're in good shape if you're reading this in time and can still head to your local GameStop.Did you catch that? There was a very small PS5 restock at Sam's Club overnight right as we were updating this GameStop PS5 restock liveblog. We also saw Best Buy earlier on Thursday afternoon.Sam's Club doesn't have nearly as many consoles on hand and isn't as popular as Walmart (which owns the club retailers, actually) or GameStop, but a few people did get the console bundle from our alert, according to the happy replies.According to the gracious followers of Matt Swider, we're getting a better idea of how many people are in line, how many consoles are in stock and when people first started to camp outside of GameStop stores around the country."There's a total of three locations with consoles in the area that are all about 10-minute drive of each other," PS5 restock seeker Rebecca D. told Matt Swider while she waited in line in Boston. At one location there were about "had about 3-5 people at 9pm ET – and one person who had already been waiting since 1pm ET."This is how it usually works: a few diehards who have been waiting so long to buy a PS5 console that they're willing to wait almost 24 hours outside of GameStop. But with between 50 and 60 consoles at stores today, our GameStop PS5 restock liveblog doesn't foresee them selling out at every location right away.We're back with the GameStop PS5 restock live blog, and wow did the line grow overnight. But you still have a chance to buy the console at key store locations.There are currently 48 people in line here at GameStop's flagship store in Boston, and they have 60 consoles on hand, according to the area's District Manager. But, of course, the line is growing quickly this morning. They ope in less than an hour. People are excited.About 60 minutes in advance of the store opening, GameStop managers count the people in line. They just handed out tickets to people – my friend who has been waiting months for the PS5 is No. 32 of 60, noting "It's finally happening."I haven't identified any resellers in this GameStop PS5 restock line, which is a relief. This is why it's sometimes better not to have PS5 for sale at MSRP.The great PS5 restock Target source Jake Randall is also scoping out the GameStop PS5 restock line, and he and Matt have been asked to take plenty of selfies with the happy (literally overnight) campers.People are starting to enter, but it appears to be two people at a time in order to adhere to social distancing guidelines for indoors.And here it is! These guys are among the first people in the US to get the PS5 from GameStop today. They got the PS5 Disc console with Far Cry 6, Ghost of Tsushima, a $50 GameStop gift card and 12-month PlayStation Plus membership.Months of waiting for the PS5... is finally over. We'll start chatting more with the people in line.Here's a video of the entire line from Jake Randall, who you should also find on Twitter .At GameStop right now to report on the in #PS5 store restock, crazy line and unfortunately as you can see I had to throw someone out of the line that was being unruly, does anyone recognize this man?! pic.twitter.com/PK1MnvMZmY October 22, 2021Cameo or creeper shot of Matt Swider live blogging from the GameStop PS5 restock line? Either way, "we love to see it," as Jake Randall would say.Frey, the author of this tweet said he's getting the PS5 for his brother. He's No. 55 in line, just five from the cut-off (60 people will get the console from this Boston store).Some exclusive GameStop PS5 restock news for you: there are now over 60 people in line at the flagship Boston, so the District Manager here is sending people to other stores in the area, and surprisingly, the numbers she shared with TechRadar leave opportunities to still get the console if you drive around.The moral of the story? The Boston area GameStops have 60 consoles (it'll slightly vary by region), and while too many people showed up here, other places have half of the inventory left. GameStop trying to redirect people to these other stores shows they actually care about people getting the console.The GameStop PS5 restock live blog will continue, even though this particular Boston store has sold out (look at the love bog entry for where inventory remains here and keep in mind, other cities may see similar situations).I'm sticking around to live blog – how's my recycle bin desk? – and will send updates about other cities where the GameStop restock is happening based on my followers intel. Also, happy to take selfies with people.Yes, I'm live blogging for you all from a ♻️recycle bin. Anything for a story to help people get a console! pic.twitter.com/ynmq0oxrZr October 22, 2021We're closing out this GameStop PS5 restock live blog today with some amazing feedback from people who actually got their console through the alerts of PS5 restock tracker Matt Swider.There are thousands of people who have replied via tweets or sent a direction message like the ones below. It's working.We had a list of all 290 addresses (it took a long time to put together) when GameStop didn't even have the correct store locations.For those doubting the accuracy of our PS5 restock alerts, just look at the impact of the thousands of people in the US who got the console because of Matt Swider's restock tweets. We had a list of all 290 addresses (it took a long time to put together) when GameStop didn't even have the correct store locations.And it's feedback like this on Twitter that keeps Matt motivated to do track PS5 and other consoles 24/7.So where and when will the next GameStop PS5 restock take place? We're already hearing of locations and dates from our retail sources.

Learn moreBy Axel Metz 25 October 2021OK, now we want oneEarlier this year, Tesla CEO Elon Musk described his company's in-development Cybertruck as a "special project" near and dear to his heart – and thanks to some brand new footage of the all-electric vehicle in action, we can see why.In a minute-long teaser video (which you'll find below) filmed by Twitter user Harsimran Bansa, the Tesla Cybertruck is seen driving on urban roads, drifting through a field and slaloming across the grounds of Tesla's unfinished Texas Gigafactory in theatrical style.Interestingly, Bansa caught a glimpse of the footage in a Tesla showroom, suggesting the video isn't a leak, per se, but an official Cybertruck teaser the company hasn't yet shared through its own social channels.Either way, it shows off the upcoming vehicle in an awesome new light – check it out below.Here you go, head on Cybertruck footage! pic.twitter.com/fQfGe0FWol October 20, 2021The new footage is so cool, in fact, that it looks like Tesla has taken inspiration from the cornfield chase in Christopher Nolan's Interstellar, with the Cybertruck kicking up plumes of dirt as it speeds through grassland in pursuit of… something – perhaps a release date?On that front, the news is less exciting. We recently learned that the Cybertruck may not hit the road until 2023, as Tesla continues to weather a supply chain storm whipped up by both the global pandemic and global microchip shortage.To those unfamiliar with Elon Musk’s much-anticipated vehicular project, the Tesla Cybertruck is unlike any road vehicle we've seen before.For starters, it will supposedly offer "better utility than a truck with more performance than a sports car," according to Tesla's official product page for the vehicle.The Cybertruck has been designed with a "nearly impenetrable" exterior shell made from "Ultra-Hard 30X Cold-Rolled stainless-steel structural skin" and "Tesla armor glass" – which should keep passengers and the vehicle itself protected from all types of damage.As for that impressive utility, the truck has been engineered with 100 cubic feet of exterior, lockable storage – found in places such as the under-bed, trunk and sail pillars – and will come prepared with on-board power and compressed air.It's heavy, sure, but the Cybertruck will also be mighty quick. Tesla is claiming it can sprint from 0-60mph in as little as 2.9 seconds, thanks to a powerful drivetrain and low center of gravity providing "extraordinary traction control and torque."As for range, the Cybertruck is set to offer up to 500 miles – which is an equally mind-blowing figure given the state of the competition right now.If these credentials prove accurate when it finally hits the road, the Cybertruck will rival ultra-premium EVs like the Mercedes EQS for performance while offering the practical versatility of utility vehicles like the electric Hummer .Musk himself has already described his latest four-wheeled project as "a glitch in the Matrix" for the auto industry – and judging by this latest footage, the Cybertruck is looking more and more like an extremely exciting reality.Axel is a London-based Staff Writer at TechRadar, reporting on everything from the latest Tesla models to newest movies as part of the site's daily news output. Having previously written for publications including Esquire and FourFourTwo, Axel is well-versed in the applications of technology beyond the desktop, and a degree in English Literature means he can occasionally be spotted slipping Hemingway quotes into stories about electric sports cars.Sign up to get breaking news, reviews, opinion, analysis and more, plus the hottest tech deals!Thank you for signing up to TechRadar.

<p>TechRadar is supported by its audience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn moreBy Cat Ellis 26 October 2021Double the range of its rivalsE-bike company Velotric (led by one of the founders of e-scooter hire company Lime) has launched a new electric bike that can keep running for up to 80 miles, and is far cheaper than other bikes in the same ballpark.After a successful crowdfunding campaign , the Velotric Discover is now in production with deliveries expected to begin in December. Backers will pay a reduced price of $1,299 (about £940 / AU$1,700), and when the bike goes on general sale in the coming months, it will have a recommended price of $2,099 (about £1,500 / AU$2,800).To put that into context, our current top-rated e-bike, the Cowboy 4 , has a maximum range of 43.5 miles in optimum conditions and costs £2,290 in the UK, with an early bird pre-order price of $1,190 in the US.If you need more range, the Specialized Turbo Vado 4.0 can keep rolling for 80 miles, but will set you back $3,550 / £2,900 (about AU$4,700).As Autoevolution reports, Velotric doesn't seem to be cutting corners when it comes to the bike's components. These include a Tesla-grade 692Wh battery certified by LG and Samsung, and a 500W motor (though in order to comply with local laws, that will need to be reduced to 250W if the bike is sold in the UK and EU).There's three-level power assist, though at the time of writing we don't know whether the settings will be customizable through an app like those of bikes with Bosch or Shimano drive units.The Discover has a hybrid design, with a step-through frame and upright riding position, coupled with a front suspension fork to absorb shock from uneven road surfaces. There's no mistaking it for a conventional push bike, but the battery is fully integrated into the frame for a slimmer profile.The North American spec includes a push-button throttle, but again, this will need to be tweaked for a EU/UK release, where e-bikes can only offer power assistance while the pedals are being turned.Overall. it's a practical design best suited to city riding. We don't yet know how much it will weigh, but it looks as though it'll be similar to the 21kg Specialized Turbo Como SL – or slightly more when you factor in the suspension fork.We hope to put the Velotric Discover through its paces ourselves once it goes on general release, so we can see whether it really rides rings around the competition when it comes to everyday commuting and errands.When you're buying an e-bike, it's important to bear in mind that the quoted range is almost always calculated under optimum conditions. The real world performance will depend on a host of factors, including total weight (including you and any cargo), tire pressure, gradient of your route, road bumps, and even the weather and your preferred riding position. Cold weather will also reduce range, as will wind resistance.The way you use the battery will have a big effect as well. The quoted range will assume you're riding the bike in 'eco' mode (its lowest power setting), but if you choose to let the motor take more of the strain then you'll get far less mileage out of it. Similarly, if you only call on assistance occasionally, you might eke out more.If you're only using your e-bike for relatively short trips around town and your regular commute, that's unlikely to be an issue, but for longer weekend rides it's worth planning your route carefully, bearing in mind that you're very unlikely to get the full quoted range out of a single charge. E-bikes are notoriously heavy , and you don't want to be left having to pedal a 20kg bicycle up a steep hill to get home and plug it in.Cat Ellis ( @CatEllisTech ) is the fitness and wellbeing editor at TechRadar.
